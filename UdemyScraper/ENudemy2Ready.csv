This covers everything you need to know to get hired: from absolute zero knowledge to being able to put things on your resume that will allow you to live the life you want.&nbsp;</p><p>Sounds too good to be true? Give me 5 minutes of your time to explain why I built this Web&nbsp;Development course and what is different here than thousands of other courses all over the internet:</p><ol><li><p><strong>I update the course every month to make sure you learn the most up to date skills! </strong>There is no wasted time here. We won’t be using outdated technologies like PHP, Wordpress and JQuery. Although still useful, outdated technologies like the above are low paying and demands for them are decreasing. In this course, you will learn the specific technologies that are the most in demand in the industry right now. These include <strong>tools and technologies used by the biggest tech companies like Google, Facebook, Instagram, etc… It is geared specifically for people that want to learn employable skills in 2023.<br><br></strong></p></li><li><p>After finishing this course, you will be able to apply for developer roles, get a promotion, or upgrade your job title as a developer and earn a higher salary. We won't be taking any shortcuts in this course. <strong>You are going to go&nbsp;from absolute zero: where you learn how the internet works. To mastery: where you build an image recognition app using a&nbsp;Machine Learning API (a subset of Artificial Intelligence) and all the other modern technologies that we learn in the course.&nbsp;Most students have commented how the projects in this course have impressed their interviewers and allowed them to get an offer.<br><br></strong></p></li><li><p>This course is taught by an instructor who has worked in Silicon Valley, and one of the top tech companies in Toronto. <strong>I have built large scale applications, and have managed teams of developers. I am not an online marketer or a salesman, but a software developer who has worked directly with these technologies.&nbsp; I love programming and believe that there needs to be a course out there that actually teaches valuable real life skills (because most of them are taught by teachers with no work experience).<br><br></strong></p></li><li><p>Your time is valuable and you don't want to spend thousands of dollars on a bootcamp. You want a course that outlines the best way to become a Web Developer, in simple and well explained terms, so that you fully understand topics instead of watching somebody on your screen and having no clue what is going on.<strong> I have taken the best pieces, tools, and practices that I have found over the years, and condensed everything into this course. 50 hours of videos doesn't mean much if the instructor isn't engaging or focuses on outdated topics.&nbsp;I made sure that everything covered in this course is efficient and focuses on getting you job ready as soon as possible!&nbsp;<br><br></strong></p></li><li><p><strong>We&nbsp;have a thriving online chat community so you really feel like you are part of a classroom and not just watching videos by yourself. </strong>You will have a chance to communicate with fellow students, work on group projects together, and contribute to open source projects. Anytime you have a question, you can ask in many locations and get help right away (including from myself).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p></li><li><p>The course is designed to <strong>give you employable skills so you can get a job</strong>. Here is what one student recently wrote after taking the course and being hired right away: <br><br><em>I’m a self taught dev, who has been out of work for ~6 months. I had some family things that came up that prevented me from seeking permanent employment, so for awhile I was Postmates/Uber delivery driver.<br>&nbsp; <br>After taking this course, I immediately got catapulted back to where I was before, but better equipped and with the knowledge to take on the next job. I had just finished the React section when I went to a recent interview, and it really helped me excel. As of today, I am officially re-employed back in the field, and it is all thanks to this course.&nbsp;I had a blast creating the final project, and FINALLY got around to learning SQL statements, and getting to use them in a project. I’m really ecstatic that Andrei went with teaching relational databases over something like MongoDB, which can also be fun, but is less practical for use on the job.&nbsp; &nbsp;So thanks Andrei&nbsp;, I really enjoyed the course and will be making sure to share it with others who find it helpful. I’m also looking forward to the new ES10 content that was recently added, and going through the DB stuff again when I go to build a personal project. - J.C.</em></p></li></ol><p><br></p><p>Think of this course like a Web Developer bootcamp. By the end, you will be comfortable using the below skills and you will be able to put them on your resume:</p><ul><li><p><strong>HTML/HTML5</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>CSS/CSS3</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>SemanticUI</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Responsive Design</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Flexbox</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>CSS&nbsp;Grid</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Bootstrap 5</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>DOM Manipulation</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Javascript (including ES6/ES7/ES8/ES9/ES10/ES2020/ES2021/ES2022)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Asynchronous JavaScript</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>HTTP/JSON/AJAX</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>React +&nbsp;Redux + React Hooks</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Git + Github</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Command Line</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Node.js</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Express.js</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>NPM</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>RESTful&nbsp;API Design</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>PostgresSQL</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>SQL</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Authentication</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Authorization</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Scalable Infrastructure</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Security</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Production and Deployment</strong></p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>You will be taken through online videos and exercises where you will be able to do the following things by the end:<br></p><ul><li><p>Build real complex applications and websites</p></li><li><p>Build an image recognition app so you can add it to your portfolio</p></li><li><p>Go into a job interview confident that you understand the fundamental building blocks of web development and the developer trends in 2023</p></li><li><p>Be able to go off on your own and grow your skills as a developer, having built a solid foundation</p></li><li><p>Learn how frontend, servers, and databases communicate and how they all fit together in the eco system</p></li><li><p>Build your own startup landing page</p></li><li><p>Go off and work remotely by being a freelance developer that can bid on projects</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p>This course is the accumulation of all of my years working in the industry, learning, and teaching. There is so much information out there, so many opinions, and so many ways of doing things, that unless you have spent the last few years working with these technologies in a company, you will never fully understand. So this course is the answer to that&nbsp;exact&nbsp;problem for you: How to gain experience when you need experience to get hired? I have gone through thousands of coding books, online tutorials and bootcamps. <strong>Throughout the years I have taken notes on what has worked and what hasn't, and I have created this course to narrow down the most efficient way to learn with the most relevant information.&nbsp;</strong> </p><p><br></p><p>I am 100% confident that you won't find a course like this out there. We're not going to be building simple todo applications&nbsp;and cat image sliders. We are going to learn actual&nbsp;practical skills that will put you into the workforce. Some unique sections that you won't find anywhere else are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>React.js + Redux:</strong>&nbsp;You will learn the library that companies like Netflix, Facebook and Instagram use to build fast, scalable applications.&nbsp;This is one of the highest in-demand skill in the industry.</p></li><li><p><strong>A day in the life of a developer:</strong>&nbsp;What will your day to day look like and what tools will you&nbsp;use?&nbsp;I will take you through a sample day at a tech company.</p></li><li><p><strong>How does the internet actually work?&nbsp;What is the history of these technologies?:</strong>&nbsp;You will actually understand the underlying concepts of the internet, and how the technologies we have now, have come to be where they are.</p></li><li><p><strong>How do you&nbsp;actually deploy a real life app so that it is secure, and won't get hacked?:</strong>&nbsp;How does a real life app get out to the public in a safe and secure way?</p></li><li><p><strong>What is Machine Learning and how you can&nbsp;harness its power:</strong>&nbsp;Whether you have heard about it or not, this is something that you will hear more and more in the coming years. Those who understand the high level concepts and can harness its power will have an advantage.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>What does your developer environment on your computer look like?:</strong>&nbsp;We will be setting up our computers with all the tools necessary of a developer so you can use the same setup when you go work in the industry.</p></li></ul><p>Why do we teach the above? Because in this day and age, <strong>just knowing HTML CSS&nbsp;and Javascript is not good enough, and you won't be able to grow in your role and command a higher salary. You will learn these things because these are the things you should know in 2023 so that you are miles ahead of the rest.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Make this&nbsp;the year that you took a risk, you learned&nbsp;highly in demand skills, you had new experiences, and you received new opportunities. I hope you join me in this journey. <br><br><strong>This is the proudest work I have ever done in my life and I am confident that you won't find a course better than this. </strong><br><br>See you inside!</p><p></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Taught by:</strong></p><p><br>Andrei is the instructor of the <strong>highest rated Web Development course on Udemy as well as one of the fastest growing. </strong>His graduates have moved on to work for some of the biggest tech companies around the world like Apple, Google, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc... He has been working as a senior software developer in Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years, and is now taking all that he has learned, to teach programming skills and to help you discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in life.</p><p>Having been a self taught programmer, he understands that there is an overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills. Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp. <strong>Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material should teach real life skills that are current and they should not waste a student's valuable time.</strong> Having learned important lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to teaching others valuable software development skills in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.</p><p>Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained. <strong>He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree.

Some of the world’s top tech teams use the tool to design scalable, easy-to-maintain solutions — Netflix, PayPal, eBay, Airbnb, and more. Why are businesses so interested in React.js implementation? Here are the benefits of adopting the framework:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Increased app development speed.</strong> The framework accepts HTML code input and has excellent subcomponent rendering support. Development teams can benefit from JSX as well — it’s an extension with a range of shortcuts that cuts the amount of code writing time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Improved code stability</strong>. React.js reduces the impact of change in the code file since the changes in parent components don’t affect the children. Such a data binding approach facilitates software testing and helps ensure stable app performance after update deployments.</p></li><li><p><strong>SEO-friendliness.</strong> React.js deals with the inability of search engine crawlers to process JS-heavy pages. Even a beginner with an entry-level react developer salary can deploy React on a server and use the virtual DOM to view the code as a regular web page in a browser.</p></li><li><p><strong>Robust toolkit.</strong> React.js has a wide range of debugging and interface design tools.</p></li><li><p><strong>Strong user community and an affordable remote react developer salary.</strong> Since a large number of teams are deploying the framework, the tool is regularly updated. There’s no shortage of user-generated content either — you can find dozens of helpful React tutorials and case studies to make the most out of the framework.</p></li></ul><p>Asking for a Senior react developer salary. It’s one of the most in-demand frameworks at the moment — that’s why business owners are willing to find professionals with a moderate mid-level react developer salary within and beyond their home regions.<br><br><strong>Enroll now!! see you in class.</strong></p><p><strong><br>Happy learning<br>Team Edyoda </strong></p>|favorite, training, fitness, browser, html, tutorials, science, startup, javascript, expert

It's about rich web apps like Google Docs as well as browser games. And of course also about regular websites like Facebook, online blogs, online shops like Amazon and much, much more!</p><p>Hence it's no wonder, that web developers are in high demand! And, besides great job perspectives, as a web developer, you can of course also easily build your own digital business!</p><p><strong>This Course Is For You!</strong></p><p>This course will teach you web development<strong> from the ground up</strong> and thanks to the 100 Days Of Code Challenge&nbsp;which is incorporated into this course (though it's optional to commit to it!), you can <strong>become a web developer in 100 days </strong>with help of this course!</p><p><strong>No prior web development knowledge is required</strong> at all to get started with this course.&nbsp;We will explore all important basics, all fundamentals and all key concepts together, step by step.</p><p>But this course is <strong>also for advanced students</strong> who already do&nbsp;have web development knowledge!&nbsp;It's a deep-dive course and hence you will be able to expand your existing knowledge by diving deeper into key fundamentals like HTML, CSS&nbsp;or NodeJS and also by exploring advanced concepts like handling payments, building REST&nbsp;APIs or website security.</p><p>Since it's a huge course, the course is built in a modular way. This means, that you can take it step by step, lecture by lecture but you can also jump right into the course sections that are most interesting to you. Of course, we recommend the step-by-step&nbsp;approach for beginners - simply because all the lectures and sections build up on each other. But as a more experienced developer, you can of course skip basics that aren't interesting to you!</p><p><strong>The 100 Days Of Code Challenge</strong></p><p>We built this course with the 100 Days Of Code&nbsp;Challenge in mind - a challenge (not invented by us) that aims to keep you motivated to code for <strong>at least 1 hour per day for 100 days</strong>.</p><p>Since this is a huge course (with around 80 hours of content!) it can be very overwhelming. And we know that many students never finish a course.</p><p>That's a pitty, because this course is <strong>packed with content, exercises, quizzes, assignments and demo projects</strong>! We build a browser-game, a blog, a travel website, an online shop and much, much more. </p><p>Therefore, we provide clear guidance on how you can take this course from A&nbsp;to Z within 100 days by spending 1 to 2 hours per day watching videos and learning. As part of the course, you get access to a companion website that provides a clear structure and you also find annotations right in the course curriculum. </p><p>Of course taking this 100&nbsp;Days&nbsp;challenge is totally optional though!&nbsp;You can take the course at your own pace as well and skip any content you're not interested in!</p><p><strong>Try It Risk-Free</strong></p><p>This course comes with a <strong>30 day money-back guarantee</strong>. If you find out that it's not for you, you can get your money back, no questions asked!</p><p><strong>What You Will&nbsp;Learn</strong></p><p>This is a huge course, packed with content and it's the web development bootcamp we would have loved to have when we learned web development.</p><p>Here's a summary of the key concepts we'll explore as part of this course:</p><ul><li><p>How the web works</p></li><li><p>Core technologies:&nbsp;HTML, CSS&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;JavaScript</p></li><li><p>Understand how HTML documents are structured and how HTML&nbsp;elements are used correctly</p></li><li><p>Learn core CSS&nbsp;concepts like the box model, flexbox, positioning, units and much more</p></li><li><p>Explore advanced CSS&nbsp;concepts like building responsive websites, layouts, custom CSS&nbsp;properties, CSS&nbsp;grid &amp;&nbsp;more</p></li><li><p>Learn browser-side JavaScript from the ground up</p></li><li><p>Understand what the DOM&nbsp;is and how you can manipulate it via JavaScript</p></li><li><p>Explore browser /&nbsp;user events and how to handle them with JavaScript</p></li><li><p>Build tons of projects (e.g. a Tic-Tac-Toe browser game) to practice and fully understand all these technologies</p></li><li><p>Dive into backend development with NodeJS&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;ExpressJS</p></li><li><p>Learn what NodeJS&nbsp;is and how it works</p></li><li><p>Build basic backend-driven websites with advanced concepts like dynamic routing or dynamic templates</p></li><li><p>Learn how to work with databases - SQL&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;NoSQL&nbsp;(and what that is)</p></li><li><p>Practice how to use SQL&nbsp;/&nbsp;NoSQL with NodeJS&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Express</p></li><li><p>Dive into advanced concepts like authentication, website security, coding patterns, file uploads, user input validation and so much more!</p></li><li><p>Again:&nbsp;Build plenty of projects (e.g. a complete online shop, from the ground up!) to practice all advanced concepts as well</p></li><li><p>Learn how to use third-party packages and services (e.g. Stripe for payments) in your websites</p></li><li><p>Move on to more specialized, advanced concepts like building REST&nbsp;APIs</p></li><li><p>Explore frontend JavaScript frameworks like Vue.js to build even more powerful web user interfaces</p></li><li><p>And so much more - simply check out the full curriculum to get a complete list!</p></li></ul><p><strong>We'd love to start this journey with you, so let's get started!</strong></p><p><em>Max &amp;&nbsp;Manuel</em></p>|huge, facebook, html, apps, rich, browser, party, javascript, google, bootcamp

It can be as simple as making a static text-based website or as elaborate as developing an interactive dynamic website. You can break web development into two different categories: frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side). Frontend code executes on the user's computer. This can include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Backend code runs on the server — this commonly includes communicating with a database and often involves languages like Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP. Web development does not necessarily include the design process — it focuses on code. A web designer builds wireframes to mockup their vision for a website and then shares that with a developer. The developer is responsible for writing the code that implements the design.</p><p><strong>What are the steps to becoming a web developer?</strong></p><p>Some web developers will obtain a degree or certification in the field. However, most jobs don't require a specific degree or level of education, just demonstrated knowledge of the field. So, it is more important that you know how to show off your skills. You could highlight your skills through relevant work experience or a portfolio of past projects. You might also share code you have developed using a platform like GitHub, or participate in solution-based forums like StackOverflow that reward you for helping others. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the first three coding languages you'll need to learn to break into web development. You need these three essential elements to create a modern website and work as a frontend web developer. HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) specifies the content of the website and builds the backbone. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles the content. JavaScript controls the interactive elements of the website.</p><p><strong>How long does it take to become a web developer?</strong></p><p>The answer to this question will depend on you. The more time you spend developing your skills, the faster you can become a web developer. The good news is that web development generally uses light-weight code that is easier to learn than many other languages. If dedicated, you can learn the basics of web development in a couple of months. But good web developers never stop learning. A better question might be, What can I do to become a better web developer faster? The answer to this question is practice. Becoming familiar with coding helps tremendously, but there is also a less obvious benefit of practicing. The more you code, the more you will run into problems or find bugs in your code. A significant aspect of web development is solving problems and debugging code. The better you get at solving problems and tracking down bugs, the faster you will get at coding.</p><p><strong>What is JavaScript?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is a curly-braced, dynamically typed, prototype-based, object-oriented programming language. It started as the programming language for the web and is one of the three layers of standard web technologies — the other two being HTML and CSS. JavaScript allows you to create and control content dynamically on a web page without requiring a page reload. Web browsers are able to interpret it, and when triggered by events, modify the HTML and CSS of a web page with dynamic updates. JavaScript also uses asynchronous calls to fetch data from web services in the background. Although it was initially only used in web browsers, JavaScript engines have since been put to use as servers with Node.js, included in desktop application frameworks like Electron, and embedded in phone frameworks like Apache Cordova.</p><p><strong>Why is JavaScript important?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is the programming language that allows users to interact with the websites that they're visiting, making it a very important language for web developers to know. In the past, most developers focused on the backend; JavaScript was only relevant when they needed to use visual effects. As web development evolved and the focus shifted towards user experience, programmers started to rely on JavaScript for their frontend code heavily. Today, most sites use JavaScript to fetch and submit data, use logic, and generate HTML in browsers. JavaScript can also communicate asynchronously with data servers in the background without interrupting the user interaction in the foreground. These features make JavaScript not only an important language but a necessary language for modern web development.</p><p><strong>What are the main uses of JavaScript?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is a text-based programming language used for client- and server-side development. Web developers have used JavaScript since its inception to add simple interactivity to web pages like modals, animated elements, or image slideshows. While that is still one of its primary uses, Javascript has evolved to building complete web applications. SPAs, or single page applications, depend on JavaScript-based frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue to bring a desktop-like application experience to the browser. However, it's important to note that web browsers aren't places that make good use of the programming language. Javascript is also popular for building web services and back-end infrastructure with Node.js. React Native, Xamarin, Ionic, and NativeScript frameworks use JavaScript for developing phone apps as well.</p><p><strong>React vs. Angular vs. Vue: what is the best JavaScript framework?</strong></p><p>Choosing the best JavaScript framework for your web project depends on what you are looking for. React is a popular framework, which means you will find a lot of community support if you need help. It is also considered relatively easy to learn but is being developed at a rapid pace. Angular is a framework that makes data binding easy so that you can template an application faster. It also uses the RxJS library to simplify asynchronous programming and Typescript (which compiles to JavaScript) for a cleaner, less error-prone development process. Some cons of Angular are that it can have a steep learning curve and can be complex. Vue is a lightweight framework, so it is easy to learn, very performant, and flexible. Some cons of Vue are limited plugins, and its flexibility can lead to irregular code.</p><p><strong>What is JSON and what is it used for?</strong></p><p>Because of the evolution of the JavaScript language, JavaScript has a variety of techniques for creating objects. But, ultimately in the background, JavaScript is using a syntax called JSON. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a standard text-based format used to represent objects in JavaScript. The same basic types of data represented in Javascript can also be represented in JSON, including strings, numbers, arrays, booleans, and JavaScript objects. Although JSON is based on the JavaScript object, it is not just used in JavaScript. It is also used as a format to transfer data from a web browser to a server and vice versa because of the format's simplicity and small size. The JSON format is used in REST APIs for this purpose and has replaced XML as the standard format for many APIs. Because of this, just about any language you use will have a method of converting data into JSON to interact with REST APIs.</p><p><strong>What is AJAX and what is it used for?</strong></p><p>AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is a technology that developers use to create better, faster and more interactive web applications. AJAX uses XHTML for content, CSS to style the page, and JavaScript for controlling content dynamically. AJAX allows you to update a web page without reloading the page (this technique is called a “SPA” or Single Page Application), request data for the page after it has loaded, receive data after the page has loaded, and send data to the server in the background. Despite XML being part of the acronym that makes up AJAX, AJAX can send and receive data in any format, including JSON or plain text. While traditional web applications use synchronous methods to send and receive information from a web server, AJAX can use asynchronous API calls in the background without blocking activity in the browser. AJAX is a data-driven rather than a page-driven technology.</p><p><strong>How can I teach myself Javascript?</strong></p><p>One of the best ways to learn to write code is through an online course that teaches you how to write JavaScript with an instructor that will explain the code, what versions you should use, and why. Learning to develop a real-world application, with an instructor explaining in a step-by-step fashion, will teach you modern code techniques.</p><p><strong>What is the best IDE for Javascript?</strong></p><p>With all of the different JavaScript IDEs available, the best option depends on how you intend to use it, along with your personal preferences. Webstorm is a popular JavaScript IDE from JetBrains. It provides fast static code analysis, integrated testing, local history, code refactoring, and debugging. While the IDE requires a paid subscription, many developers swear by it because of its compatibility with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Those searching for a free option might prefer VS Code. This general-purpose, open-source IDE comes with IntelliSense, Git integration, and debugging features built-in. Many third-party extensions are available to add new language and programming features, making it one of the more flexible choices. Atom is another general-purpose IDE that is popular with JavaScript developers. It is also free, open-source, and has third-party extensions to add.</p><p><strong>What is HTML and why is it important?</strong></p><p>HTML stands for hyper-text markup language. Whether on a mobile device or a computer, every website that you browse is designed with HTML. HTML isn’t a “programming language,” but rather a “formatting language.” It tells a browser how to display text, images, and other media elements. When HTML was first developed, it was fairly simple. For example, the text on a page could be bolded, italicized, or underlined, and images could be resized and aligned. Today, HTML is much more complex and dynamic, allowing front-end developers to create any layout or setup they desire.</p><p><strong>Why is CSS and Javascript important for HTML?</strong></p><p>HTML is a formatting language, not a programming language. Javascript is often necessary to make HTML “dynamic.” While HTML can make it so that text is displayed on the screen, Javascript can update this text or make it move. Javascript is used for both front-end and back-end development, hand-in-hand with HTML, to create complex and attractive web designs. Meanwhile, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are used to organize the look and feel of a website and make the website easier to update and manipulate. Today, HTML, CSS, and Javascript are frequently used to develop responsive web designs — designs that react to a user’s environment for a better user experience.</p><p><strong>What is an HTML element and why is it important?</strong></p><p>HTML is designed on a modular basis, meaning every part of the web page has a specific “place.” An HTML element is a part of the page. Common HTML elements include “&lt;p&gt;” for a “paragraph” and “&lt;title&gt;” for the “title” of the page. In fact, the entirety of the HTML page is within the “&lt;html&gt;” element. Elements are begun and ended with tags, so a title would be written: “&lt;title&gt;This is the Title to the page.&lt;/title&gt;” Organizing code this way makes it easier to reference and control. Each element may also have characteristics. For instance, the “&lt;p&gt;” (paragraph) tag can be aligned in a certain direction. These are the basic building blocks of HTML and what most designers should learn first.</p><p><strong>Is HTML a programming language?</strong></p><p>HTML is not considered a programming language but rather a markup or formatting language. This is an important distinction. Formatting languages merely control how things are displayed on a visual level, whereas programming languages are more dynamic; they use logic gates to determine the behavior of a program. But there is some crossover. “DHTML,” for instance, refers to Dynamic HTML. It is a type of HTML augmented by Javascript to make it easier to adjust on the fly. Because HTML, Javascript, and CSS are so frequently used together, they can often be folded together, which can contribute to some confusion regarding whether HTML is a programming language.</p><p><strong>Is HTML hard to learn?</strong></p><p>HTML is known as one of the easiest languages to learn. It’s also one of the most ubiquitous. Many individuals interested in front-end, back-end, or full-stack development will learn HTML first. While HTML is largely intended for websites as a language, it is also used in many other programs. For example, when you create an email signature, you will usually be using HTML. Emails themselves use a combination of HTML and CSS. An advantage (and an occasional double-edged sword) to HTML is that it is very forgiving. You can get some HTML wrong, and your page will still be displayed, if not exactly how you want it to be.</p><p><strong>What jobs use HTML?</strong></p><p>Nearly any development or design job will require a cursory understanding of HTML. HTML has also evolved dramatically since it was originally developed; it is far more complex and standardized than before. Because of this, even those who have been experts in HTML during their career may need to undergo an HTML refresher periodically. Most jobs that require HTML will involve web design, web development, or layout and design. For example, someone who manages a content management system such as WordPress may not need to know any other programming languages but should still know HTML basics. Similarly, someone who formats online newsletters or an online magazine in an administrative capacity may not need to be a web designer or web developer but might need to understand the principles of HTML.</p><p><strong>What is responsive design?</strong></p><p>Responsive design is a new type of design intended to respond to the platform and environment that a user is on. When HTML was created, most people used PCs. Today, people can browse a website on a PC, phone, tablet, or even a game console. In the past, developers created separate sites for “desktop” and “mobile.” While it worked, it wasn't easy to maintain. Rather than creating separate sites, responsive design generates the site based on the environment it detects. This greatly reduces the amount of development and maintenance for the site. Responsive design is generally achieved with a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p><p><strong>What is Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)?</strong></p><p>CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used to style markup language. Markup languages include HTML, XHML, XML, and other XML-based languages. The most common use of CSS is to style HTML web pages. Although HTML doesn't need CSS to function, every web page would look the same without it. With CSS, you can target specific elements in a web page and change the look and arrangement on the page. CSS can make an embedded image small or cover the entire webpage as a background. You can enlarge a heading and apply a specific font to stand out from the rest of the page. Other things you can do with CSS include changing the color of elements, making elements float to one side of the page, and the list goes on. Every web page uses HTML, and every web page that has its unique look uses CSS.</p><p><strong>What careers use CSS?</strong></p><p>CSS applies to any career that involves web development. Web designers create the templates, mockups, and styles for a website using HTML and CSS that web developers use to build websites. Front-end web developers use CSS with HTML and JavaScript to build front-end web applications that run in the browser. Fullstack web developers create both the part of a web application that runs in the browser and on the server and need to know CSS to make the front-end look good. Content managers may need to know CSS to apply custom styles to articles they publish through a content management system like WordPress. Other job titles that may require you to know CSS include junior web developer, social media manager, website editor, content editor, website project manager, website support specialist, and webmaster.</p><p><strong>What skills should I have before learning CSS?</strong></p><p>Before learning CSS, you should know the basics of using a computer and how to use a text editor because that is where you will be writing CSS. You should also be familiar with web browsers for browsing the web because it will inform your use of CSS. Since you may end up using specialized tools to write CSS, you should know how to install software on your computer and create and manage files and folders on your computer so you can create a CSS project. Once you have those skills down, the next thing to learn is HTML; after all, CSS is nothing without an HTML page to apply styles.

660594|The Fundamentals of Web Front-End Development|379|/course/crashing-course-for-web-front-end-development/|frontend|0|4.4|en|Le Deng|<p>More than 5 hours of lectures covering HTML, CSS, BootStrap, JavaScript and JQuery. You don't need to know every detail of the topics to get started on building your website.</p><p>9 projects as assignments will force you to learn through yourself, whose knowledge will eventually retain in your body.</p><p><strong>Why this course?</strong></p><p>There are many web front-end courses out there. This course has the following features:</p><ul><li>You don't need to know every detail to get started. This course goes through the essential parts of each subject with examples, not to a wildly comprehensive level, but enough to get you started.</li><li>HTML + CSS + BootStrap + JavaScript + JQuery. A good package of skills and pretty much what you need to start to build a modern website front-end.</li><li>No detail steps for your projects. You have to rely on yourself to use the knowledge learned to build your own projects. This could be hard. However, you would definitely be able to achieve it with patience and efforts.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Why there is no detail steps in those projects?</strong><br></p><p>Usually a project is guided as a walk-through in other online courses. The good side is that you can follow the steps to build whatever it instructs you. However, simply typing by following instructions doesn't give much to you. You have to first understand and then do it on your own to retain those knowledge in your body. Project without detail steps trains you on how to attack the problem (the project to be built in this case) using the knowledge learned. Hence, you need to do your research and find ways to solve each issue blocking you from going further. </p><p>There are two ways of thinking, reactive thinking and proactive thinking. Reactive is you start to remember something after logically reminded by other things. Proactive is thinking without direct reminding or hints. The latter is much more difficult than the former. Doing projects by reverse engineering trains you in the latter form.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What if I get stuck or don't understand it?</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Well, that's the point of learning, right? Try to search online and use resources to solve your problems. You need to think and train yourself to learn how to attack any obstacles that in front of you.<br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>But there are other courses that have longer duration and wider coverage on those topics?</strong></p><p>You can learn comprehensively or learn what is enough to get you started. I personally enjoy knowing just what I need so that I can get my hands dirty on doing stuff. Look at those topics that are covered in this book, each one could be a complete book or course to study. It all depends on what you are interested in.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>So what should I plan to do?</strong></p><p>1. Watch the tutorial video and know the element topics in the tutorial.</p><p>2. Practice writing code of each element topic yourself and see the outcome of it. Any trouble, google it.</p><p>For project, you can design the layout first and then add in JavaScript/JQuery to control the logic.</p>|hours, typing, lectures, website, web, javascript, html, online, google, tutorial
2027138|The Result-Oriented Web Developer Course - BOOTCAMP 2022|899|/course/result-oriented-web-developer-course/|frontend|0|4.6|en|Vertex Academy|<p><em>This full stack web development bootcamp sets</em><strong><em> a NEW STANDARD in online courses. </em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Here are 5 big reasons why:</em></strong></p><p>1.&nbsp; <strong>This full stack web development bootcamp is and always will be 100% up-to-date.</strong> The biggest problem facing people who are looking for quality online courses is that it can be difficult to find one that’s actually up-to-date. This can be quite demotivating and annoying, especially for beginners. But our students can be sure that this course is always up-to-date, because we meticulously re-record our lessons to reflect the latest in web development.</p><p>2. <strong>You will not find explanations of programming concepts so easy to understand in any other course on the Internet. </strong>We spend an enormous amount of time looking for the best way to explain complex concepts using simple terms, animations, illustrations, graphs, etc. Our method is always structured to begin by demonstrating theory on well-planned and animated slides before showing the theory in practice. </p><p>3. <strong>By studying with us, you will be taught by professional online and offline bootcamp instructors. What's more, you will feel as if you are being taught one-on-one by a private instructor</strong>. Most people don’t have $10,000-$20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp. But, fortunately, there is no need to. This full stack web developer course was developed by a team of professional online and offline bootcamp instructors.</p><p>4. <strong>You can be 100% sure that every question you submit will be answered to your satisfaction by our instructors! </strong>Another all too common gripe about many online courses is that the instructors don’t respond to questions raised by their students in the Q&amp;A section. However, You will never be alone because we understand how important it is to help beginners on their way to becoming web developers and getting their first job.</p><p><em>5. </em><strong>You will be taught how to build major projects as though you are already working as a freelancer or as a web developer in an IT company</strong><em>. </em>In this course you will learn how to build - from scratch - real, complex projects that can be added to your portfolio with pride. All projects teach you how to think like and develop the necessary skills of … <strong>A Programmer!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><em>Your success is PRIORITY #1 to us! </em></p><p><br></p><p>From Udemy reviews:</p><p><em>Absolute quality. I&nbsp;am learning these topics as a complete beginner, having/wanting/needing to change industries because of this pandemic. I knew I would want several resources so purchased multiple bootcamps to learn from. This one is of the absolute best! Not only </em><strong><em>the material is current</em></strong><em>,</em><strong><em> it is presented in an incredibly descriptive manner with plenty of visuals and instruction</em></strong><em>. I&nbsp;highly recommend this to anyone starting out in this field or coming back to learn the basics. Kudos. - Stephanie Quintana </em></p><p><br></p><p><em>“…</em><strong><em> I've used all the big names in online courses, and this is the most comprehensive course I've taken.</em></strong><em> On other learning platforms, oftentimes you're only coding a portion of the site and I think you miss the big picture. In this course, you build the projects completely from the ground up. And the instructors are incredibly responsive to all questions. Give these guys your money, they deserve it!” – Andrew S.</em> </p><p><br></p><p><em>“I did a lot of research until I ultimately decided on this course, and I'm very happy with the choice I made. I really love the way in which the lessons are taught by both demonstrating and allowing you to practice along. Any and </em><strong><em>all questions asked are answered in-depth and timeously, which I truly appreciate</em></strong><em>” – Ryan Griffiths</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>-- WE GUARANTEE THAT --</strong></p><p><strong>-- THERE IS NO WEB DEVELOPMENT BOOTCAMP LIKE THIS ON&nbsp;THE&nbsp;MARKET --</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reason #1:</strong> <strong>This course is taught by professional web development bootcamp instructors</strong></p><p>We have 10+ years’ experience in software development and 6+ years’ experience conducting highly-effective web development bootcamps. Our students become web developers <strong>from scratch in the shortest possible time</strong> thanks to our unique teaching method.</p><p><em>“The instructor has a talent for knowing what questions you have ... and makes the right thing clear at the right time. This is the mark of a great teacher. “– Bob Douglas, USA</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reason #2: This course sets a NEW STANDARD in online education</strong></p><p><strong><em>We spend lots of time developing strict methodology and premium, animated slides. Our teaching method completely distinguishes our courses from all others on the Internet.</em></strong></p><p>Whereas other instructors explain theory by coding-and-coding on a black screen, our teaching method flows like a <strong>well-illustrated book</strong>. First, <strong>all theory is explained through visuals and animations, </strong>showing you exactly what the code is actually doing. And then, when you have already gotten the concept, it is shown in practice.</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Each video starts with awesome animation which explains the concept and …then reinforced with practical examples. You guys totally understand how a student thinks and you guys know how to teach, which is very rare and a God-gifted quality.” – Vivek, India</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reason #3: Throughout this bootcamp you will never be alone</strong></p><p>We know how important it is to get timely and detailed answers from the instructor when you are learning web development. That’s why we are always ready to answer your questions. The success of our students is PRIORITY #1.</p><p>With other courses many instructors don’t answer at all or you could be waiting for 5-10 days to get an answer. <strong>We answer literally every question of every student</strong> within 24 hours. </p><p><em>“Highly recommended! Straight to the point tutorials and concise, they always let you know what's best practice and what the smartest approach is. Big plus that they always answer questions as soon as they can!

New tools are released every day, and it’s crucial to stay on top of the latest knowledge for being a better React developer. You will always have up-to-date content for this course at <strong>no extra charge</strong>. </p><p><strong>What is Web development?</strong></p><p>Web development is a broad description of the tasks and technologies that go into creating a website. It can be as simple as making a static text-based website or as elaborate as developing an interactive dynamic website. You can break web development into two different categories: frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side). Frontend code executes on the user's computer. This can include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Backend code runs on the server — this commonly includes communicating with a database and often involves languages like Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP. Web development does not necessarily include the design process — it focuses on code. A web designer builds wireframes to mockup their vision for a website and then shares that with a developer. The developer is responsible for writing the code that implements the design.</p><p><strong>What are the steps to becoming a web developer?</strong></p><p>Some web developers will obtain a degree or certification in the field. However, most jobs don't require a specific degree or level of education, just demonstrated knowledge of the field. So, it is more important that you know how to show off your skills. You could highlight your skills through relevant work experience or a portfolio of past projects. You might also share code you have developed using a platform like GitHub, or participate in solution-based forums like StackOverflow that reward you for helping others. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the first three coding languages you'll need to learn to break into web development. You need these three essential elements to create a modern website and work as a front-end web developer. HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) specifies the content of the website and builds the backbone. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles the content. JavaScript controls the interactive elements of the website.</p><p><strong>How long does it take to become a web developer?</strong></p><p>The answer to this question will depend on you. The more time you spend developing your skills, the faster you can become a web developer. The good news is that web development generally uses lightweight code that is easier to learn than many other languages. If dedicated, you can learn the basics of web development in a couple of months. But good web developers never stop learning. A better question might be, What can I do to become a better web developer faster? The answer to this question is practice. Becoming familiar with coding helps tremendously, but there is also a less obvious benefit of practicing. The more you code, the more you will run into problems or find bugs in your code. A significant aspect of web development is solving problems and debugging code. The better you get at solving problems and tracking down bugs, the faster you will get at coding.</p><p><strong>What is React?</strong></p><p>React is a front-end library in Javascript that was developed by Facebook. The simplest definition of React is that it is a user interface library used for building UI components for the web. But if that was all React did, it would be little more than a template library. Developers define components in React by using an HTML-like syntax called JSX. These encapsulated components manage their own state, making it simple to pass rich data to a component and keep the state of the application and its components out of the Document Object Model (DOM). These features give React components the ability to react dynamically and efficiently to changes in their state. A set of simple components in React can be composed into either simple single-page applications or large, complex web applications.</p><p><strong>What is React used for?</strong></p><p>React is an open-source JavaScript frontend library. Some developers consider it a frontend framework because it does more than standard libraries usually do. The most common use of React is to build dynamic user interfaces for single-page web applications. But the structure of React makes it useful for more than just creating websites. JSX, which is one feature of React, is a syntax extension for Javascript that provides a template for the HTML and manages the state of the element. But JSX can be used as an interface for things other than HTML. React Native uses React to build mobile applications. Here, JSX becomes an interface for mobile UIs instead of HTML. There are even a few libraries that use React and JSX to interact with and manage hardware like React Hardware.</p><p><strong>How does React work?</strong></p><p>React encourages engineers to write code using a Functional Programming approach. Engineers create components, which are normal Javascript functions. These functions return information to tell React what content should be displayed on the screen. The real power of React comes from the ability to nest or compose these functions inside of one another. This nesting ability encourages code reuse and allows an engineer to write a component a single time, but in many different places.</p><p><strong>Is React a framework or library?</strong></p><p>Frameworks provide an opinionated approach to building an entire application. Libraries, on the other hand, assist in building a single aspect of an application. With this in mind, React is a library. It assists engineers in presenting HTML in the browser. React has no opinions on how data is fetched, how styling is applied, or how the app is deployed or built.</p><p><strong>What is React Native?</strong></p><p>Created by Facebook, React Native is an open-source-based mobile application framework that uses only JavaScript, making it capable of supporting both Android and iOS platforms. React, also known as React.js, saves time and effort for developers since they only need one programming language. The Native element allows developers to create JavaScript components to design software programs that run on various devices and platforms, such as smartphones, smart TVs, and laptops. With React Native, developers use the same concepts used in the original React framework to design a rich mobile user interface (UI) for various environments from existing components.</p><p><strong>Is React worth learning?</strong></p><p>Yes, React is worth learning. There are a couple of reasons. The first one is that React is in high demand in the software development job market and has been for a few years. If you learn to code in React and can do it well, you will increase your chances of finding a job. This alone is another reason it is worth learning. Website users no longer will settle for old-fashioned sites that won't update without a page reload. React’s method of dynamically updating the HTML of a web page fits these users' needs and improves their experience. React has also been around a few years and has stood the test of time. A large portion of websites, both small and large, use React as a frontend framework.</p><p><strong>Is React hard to learn?</strong></p><p>Every technology or programming language has a learning curve, and React is no different. But it is easy to learn if you are dedicated and determined to create frontend web applications. To make learning React simpler, you should stick to the basics of React before you add any extra libraries, as that will only complicate your learning experience in the beginning. Since React is a Javascript framework, a solid grounding in Javascript will give you a head start. With this knowledge, the unique concept of JSX, React's templating language, and the way React uses state will be much easier to grasp.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and ReactJS, and which one should I learn?</strong></p><p>React, or React.JS, is a front-end Javascript library for building UI components for the web. If you are interested in web development, React is the perfect library to learn to create interactive, dynamic single-page apps, or even full-scale web applications. React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications for both the Android phone and Apple's iPhone. React Native is still React, which means the syntax and workflow for building applications are basically the same, but the generated components are different. In React, web components are generated. In React Native, the generated components interact with a phone's native APIs. If your focus is web development, then you should learn React. If you want to build mobile applications, it is best to learn React first and become familiar with the technology before you try React Native.</p><p><strong>Why is React so popular?</strong></p><p>There are many reasons why React is popular. One reason is that Facebook developed it. The social proof is that if it is good enough for Facebook, one of the most popular social networks on the web, it should be good enough for other applications. React also solved many of the past issues that developers had with developing single-page applications (SPAs). React came out when SPAs were becoming popular, and all the existing frameworks to build them made development complicated and prone to bugs. One feature that makes it better than past libraries is that React is relatively easy to use. Its components are reusable, plus React's use of the virtual DOM makes it very performant. React should remain popular in the future as each new release brings new features and performance improvements.</p><p><strong>What is Node.Js and what is it used for?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is a server environment built for fast and easily scalable network applications. It was built on Chrome’s JavaScript runtime and uses an event-driven, non-blocking model that makes it the best fit for applications that run on distributed devices and need to run in real-time. By using JavaScript, node.Js can be put to work by many software developers familiar with JavaScript. Because the code is open-source, you can also use it on any platform (Mac OS, Windows, or Linux). Node.js is the architecture for creating websites and real-time applications because it’s easy for teams to learn, and it’s fast. Examples of applications that use node.Js include video conferencing apps, chat servers, eCommerce software, and collaborative online gaming.</p><p><strong>What are the advantages of Node.Js?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is open-source, meaning it’s free code for all developers. On top of that, it also means that there is a thriving community of Node.Js users and programmers that all add to the knowledge base. Many are happy to share their flavor of the code with other developers, and collectively, the Node.Js environment continues to be enhanced. Because Node.Js uses JavaScript, there is a large pool of developers that understand and can code in the environment. It’s also a relatively simple environment for new team members to learn, making it an efficient choice for development teams with people that need training. Node.Js was developed on Push technology instead of web sockets, which is why it’s the preferred choice for real-time communication applications and programs that need to be highly scalable.</p><p><strong>What does it mean that Node.Js is a runtime system?</strong></p><p>A runtime system is a platform where a software program runs. It’s essentially an environment housing the collection of software and hardware that allows an application to execute (or run). Node.Js is a runtime system because it provides the environment necessary for applications to run within it, and no additional code or hardware is required. Because Node.Js makes use of JavaScript, it’s a runtime system that provides a framework where you can use JavaScript to create and run programs. The JavaScript programming language (which is quite popular) is then automatically translated into machine code for the hardware to run the program in real-time. It’s an efficient system, making it the preferred choice for many software and tech companies.</p><p><strong>What is microservices architecture and how can Node.Js be used for it?</strong></p><p>Microservices architecture is a software development style or method where single-function modules originate. Each has a very well-defined operation and interface and can deploy on its own. In essence, it’s a way of developing modules that you can repurpose from one program or application to another. When you create an application, it’s a collection of modules that have been thoroughly tested and are well-maintained. The modules are typically built around different business-specific capabilities and are then loosely coupled to other modules when deployed as part of a program. You can use Node.Js in microservices architecture as the language of choice for one, some, or all of the microservices (or modules). The beauty of microservices is that you can use the best language for the specific microservice. But where highly scalable, fast programs are needed, Node.Js would be a top contender.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Video and Audio Production Quality</strong></p><p>All our content is created/produced as <strong>high-quality video/audio</strong> to provide you with the best learning experience.</p><p>You will be,</p><ul><li><p>Seeing clearly</p></li><li><p>Hearing clearly</p></li><li><p>Moving through the course without distractions</p></li></ul><p><strong>You'll also get:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Lifetime Access to The Course</p></li><li><p>Fast &amp; Friendly Support in the Q&amp;A section</p></li><li><p>Udemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download</p></li></ul><p>Dive in now!</p><p><strong>Mern Full Stack Web Application with React &amp; Web Development</strong></p><p>We offer <strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions.</p><p>See you in the class!</p>|updating, nodejs, websites, graphql, apps, web, stackoverflow, browser, html, javascript

It can be as simple as making a static text-based website or as elaborate as developing an interactive dynamic website. You can break web development into two different categories: frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side). Frontend code executes on the user's computer. This can include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Backend code runs on the server — this commonly includes communicating with a database and often involves languages like Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP. Web development does not necessarily include the design process — it focuses on code. A web designer builds wireframes to mockup their vision for a website and then shares that with a developer. The developer is responsible for writing the code that implements the design.</p><p><strong>What are the steps to becoming a web developer?</strong></p><p>Some web developers will obtain a degree or certification in the field. However, most jobs don't require a specific degree or level of education, just demonstrated knowledge of the field. So, it is more important that you know how to show off your skills. You could highlight your skills through relevant work experience or a portfolio of past projects. You might also share code you have developed using a platform like GitHub, or participate in solution-based forums like StackOverflow that reward you for helping others. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the first three coding languages you'll need to learn to break into web development. You need these three essential elements to create a modern website and work as a frontend web developer. HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) specifies the content of the website and builds the backbone. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles the content. JavaScript controls the interactive elements of the website.</p><p><strong>How long does it take to become a web developer?</strong></p><p>The answer to this question will depend on you. The more time you spend developing your skills, the faster you can become a web developer. The good news is that web development generally uses light-weight code that is easier to learn than many other languages. If dedicated, you can learn the basics of web development in a couple of months. But good web developers never stop learning. A better question might be, What can I do to become a better web developer faster? The answer to this question is practice. Becoming familiar with coding helps tremendously, but there is also a less obvious benefit of practicing. The more you code, the more you will run into problems or find bugs in your code. A significant aspect of web development is solving problems and debugging code. The better you get at solving problems and tracking down bugs, the faster you will get at coding.</p><p><strong>What is JavaScript?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is a curly-braced, dynamically typed, prototype-based, object-oriented programming language. It started as the programming language for the web and is one of the three layers of standard web technologies — the other two being HTML and CSS. JavaScript allows you to create and control content dynamically on a web page without requiring a page reload. Web browsers are able to interpret it, and when triggered by events, modify the HTML and CSS of a web page with dynamic updates. JavaScript also uses asynchronous calls to fetch data from web services in the background. Although it was initially only used in web browsers, JavaScript engines have since been put to use as servers with Node.js, included in desktop application frameworks like Electron, and embedded in phone frameworks like Apache Cordova.</p><p><strong>Why is JavaScript important?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is the programming language that allows users to interact with the websites that they're visiting, making it a very important language for web developers to know. In the past, most developers focused on the backend; JavaScript was only relevant when they needed to use visual effects. As web development evolved and the focus shifted towards user experience, programmers started to rely on JavaScript for their frontend code heavily. Today, most sites use JavaScript to fetch and submit data, use logic, and generate HTML in browsers. JavaScript can also communicate asynchronously with data servers in the background without interrupting the user interaction in the foreground. These features make JavaScript not only an important language but a necessary language for modern web development.</p><p><strong>What is HTML and why is it important?</strong></p><p>HTML stands for hyper-text markup language. Whether on a mobile device or a computer, every website that you browse is designed with HTML. HTML isn’t a “programming language,” but rather a “formatting language.” It tells a browser how to display text, images, and other media elements. When HTML was first developed, it was fairly simple. For example, the text on a page could be bolded, italicized, or underlined, and images could be resized and aligned. Today, HTML is much more complex and dynamic, allowing front-end developers to create any layout or setup they desire.</p><p><strong>Why is CSS and Javascript important for HTML?</strong></p><p>HTML is a formatting language, not a programming language. Javascript is often necessary to make HTML “dynamic.” While HTML can make it so that text is displayed on the screen, Javascript can update this text or make it move. Javascript is used for both front-end and back-end development, hand-in-hand with HTML, to create complex and attractive web designs. Meanwhile, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are used to organize the look and feel of a website and make the website easier to update and manipulate. Today, HTML, CSS, and Javascript are frequently used to develop responsive web designs — designs that react to a user’s environment for a better user experience.</p><p><strong>What is Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)?</strong></p><p>CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used to style markup language. Markup languages include HTML, XHML, XML, and other XML-based languages. The most common use of CSS is to style HTML web pages. Although HTML doesn't need CSS to function, every web page would look the same without it. With CSS, you can target specific elements in a web page and change the look and arrangement on the page. CSS can make an embedded image small or cover the entire webpage as a background. You can enlarge a heading and apply a specific font to stand out from the rest of the page. Other things you can do with CSS include changing the color of elements, making elements float to one side of the page, and the list goes on. Every web page uses HTML, and every web page that has its unique look uses CSS.</p><p><strong>What careers use CSS?</strong></p><p>CSS applies to any career that involves web development. Web designers create the templates, mockups, and styles for a website using HTML and CSS that web developers use to build websites. Front-end web developers use CSS with HTML and JavaScript to build front-end web applications that run in the browser. Fullstack web developers create both the part of a web application that runs in the browser and on the server and need to know CSS to make the front-end look good. Content managers may need to know CSS to apply custom styles to articles they publish through a content management system like WordPress. Other job titles that may require you to know CSS include junior web developer, social media manager, website editor, content editor, website project manager, website support specialist, and webmaster.</p><p><strong>What is React Native?</strong></p><p>Created by Facebook, React Native is an open-source-based mobile application framework that uses only JavaScript, making it capable of supporting both Android and iOS platforms. React, also known as React.js, saves time and effort for developers since they only need one programming language. The Native element allows developers to create JavaScript components to design software programs that run on various devices and platforms, such as smartphones, smart TVs, and laptops. With React Native, developers use the same concepts used in the original React framework to design a rich mobile user interface (UI) for various environments from existing components.</p><p><strong>What careers use React Native?</strong></p><p>Businesses that want to create mobile apps for iOS and Android simultaneously to ensure a seamless rollout need developers with a background in React Native. Careers in mobile app development that rely on React Native can count on professionals who can design and build stunning UIs in multiple platforms since it works hand-in-hand with platforms like Windows and tvOS. React Native developers are also vital to helping iOS, and Android companies update and otherwise modernize their apps with features like push notifications and animation for better effectiveness for mobile app subscribers. Developers with a background in React Native might work in full-stack development, designing and refining web-based games, websites, mobile apps, and more.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and Google Flutter?</strong></p><p>Google Flutter offers developers a UI toolkit that has some similarities to React Native. Flutter also has a native component and compiles web, mobile, and desktop applications from a single collection of source codes. Relying on existing code, Flutter is also a free and open-source framework for developers. Until this point, the two frameworks might sound similar. However, React Native is based on and only uses JavaScript, while Flutter only has a loose connection to the language. Google Flutter primarily uses a new language called Dart. Other differences between the two involve sourcing the tool itself and the installation process, setup and configuration, UI component and development, and community support.</p><p><strong>What is React?</strong></p><p>React is a front-end library in Javascript that was developed by Facebook. The simplest definition of React is that it is a user interface library used for building UI components for the web. But if that was all React did, it would be little more than a template library. Developers define components in React by using an HTML-like syntax called JSX. These encapsulated components manage their own state, making it simple to pass rich data to a component and keep the state of the application and its components out of the Document Object Model (DOM). These features give React components the ability to react dynamically and efficiently to changes in their state. A set of simple components in React can be composed into either simple single-page applications or large, complex web applications.</p><p><strong>What is React used for?</strong></p><p>React is an open-source JavaScript frontend library. Some developers consider it a frontend framework because it does more than standard libraries usually do. The most common use of React is to build dynamic user interfaces for single-page web applications. But the structure of React makes it useful for more than just creating websites. JSX, which is one feature of React, is a syntax extension for Javascript that provides a template for the HTML and manages the state of the element. But JSX can be used as an interface for things other than HTML. React Native uses React to build mobile applications. Here, JSX becomes an interface for mobile UIs instead of HTML. There are even a few libraries that use React and JSX to interact with and manage hardware like React Hardware.</p><p><strong>What is Node.Js and what is it used for?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is a server environment built for fast and easily scalable network applications. It was built on Chrome’s JavaScript runtime and uses an event-driven, non-blocking model that makes it the best fit for applications that run on distributed devices and need to run in real-time. By using JavaScript, node.Js can be put to work by many software developers familiar with JavaScript. Because the code is open-source, you can also use it on any platform (Mac OS, Windows, or Linux). Node.js is the architecture for creating websites and real-time applications because it’s easy for teams to learn, and it’s fast. Examples of applications that use node.Js include video conferencing apps, chat servers, eCommerce software, and collaborative online gaming.</p><p><strong>What are the advantages of Node.Js?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is open-source, meaning it’s free code for all developers. On top of that, it also means that there is a thriving community of Node.Js users and programmers that all add to the knowledge base. Many are happy to share their flavor of the code with other developers, and collectively, the Node.Js environment continues to be enhanced. Because Node.Js uses JavaScript, there is a large pool of developers that understand and can code in the environment. It’s also a relatively simple environment for new team members to learn, making it an efficient choice for development teams with people that need training. Node.Js was developed on Push technology instead of web sockets, which is why it’s the preferred choice for real-time communication applications and programs that need to be highly scalable.</p><p><strong>What does it mean that Node.Js is a runtime system?</strong></p><p>A runtime system is a platform where a software program runs. It’s essentially an environment housing the collection of software and hardware that allows an application to execute (or run). Node.Js is a runtime system because it provides the environment necessary for applications to run within it, and no additional code or hardware is required. Because Node.Js makes use of JavaScript, it’s a runtime system that provides a framework where you can use JavaScript to create and run programs. The JavaScript programming language (which is quite popular) is then automatically translated into machine code for the hardware to run the program in real-time. It’s an efficient system, making it the preferred choice for many software and tech companies.<br><strong><br>No prior knowledge is needed!</strong></p><p><strong>Why would you want to take this course?</strong></p><p>Our answer is simple: The quality of teaching.</p><p>When you enroll, you will feel our seasoned instructors' expertise.</p><p><strong>Video and Audio Production Quality</strong></p><p>All our videos are created/produced as <strong>high-quality video and audio</strong> to provide you the best learning experience.</p><p>You will be,</p><ul><li><p>Seeing clearly</p></li><li><p>Hearing clearly</p></li><li><p>Moving through the course without distractions</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>You'll also get:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Lifetime Access to The Course</p></li><li><p>Fast &amp; Friendly Support in the Q&amp;A section</p></li><li><p>Udemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download</p></li></ul><p>Dive in now </p><p><strong>Full Stack Web Development with Mern Full Stack Project</strong></p><p>We offer <strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions.</p><p>See you in the course!</p>|hypertext, browser, java, xml, nodejs, webmaster, html, html5, stackoverflow, javascript

2014178|*UPDATED* JavaScript Complete Grandmaster 2022|1099|/course/new-javascript-grandmaster/|frontend|0|4.8|en|Clyde Matthew|<p><strong>What this course covers?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is the #1 scripting language of the web, where a lot of the dynamic and styled content is handled by JavaScript in the background. But before using this language to create dynamic websites, you need to have a firm grasp of how it works behind the scenes.</p><p>By the end of this course, you'll be able to “speak” JavaScript by gaining an understanding of how the browser uses it, what <strong>variables, objects</strong> and <strong>functions</strong> are, what different <strong>data types</strong> there are and how to manipulate content on a website. We dig deeper and create our own <strong>dialog methods</strong> from scratch. We learn about the <strong>arrow syntax</strong>, <strong>Math.random()</strong> function, <strong>looping</strong> through objects and <strong>arrays</strong>, working with <strong>dates</strong>. We look at <strong>prototypes</strong>,<strong> JS&nbsp;Engines</strong>, the <strong>Execution Stack</strong> and a <strong><em>whole bunch more!</em></strong></p><p>Through practical examples, this course helps you understand JavaScript piece by piece. And we use the latest and best features of JavaScript along the way so you can stay ahead of the pack.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>*** A&nbsp;detailed JavaScript course on Udemy ***</em></strong></p><p>Successful programmers know more than rote learning a few lines of JavaScript code. They also know the fundamentals of how the language works, its strength and weaknesses, and how the machine uses what they write to create amazing and functional websites.</p><p>I&nbsp;want you to become a successful programming Grandmaster.</p><p>I&nbsp;want you to be able to apply JavaScript to your webpage.</p><p>This course is perfect for you.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Description</strong></p><p>Hi there, my name is Clyde and together we’re going to discover JavaScript and apply it to practical situations. We're going to practice and learn and emerge confident to tackle any challenges modern programs and websites throw at us.</p><p>After completing a few (unrelated) university degrees, and post grad studies, I developed a fascination for web design and software languages. For several years I have immersed myself in this. I spent a fair bit on top courses and went on to apply the knowledge practically. I recognized gaps in some of the courses I’ve taken and hence my course teaches what I wish I was taught. My intention is to share the knowledge with you in an easy to follow manner, so that we can benefit together. You benefit form learning, and I from sharing in your success.</p><p>This course is for beginners and for intermediates. If you know the basics, you may want to skip the first few sections.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Download all course content</strong></p><p>I&nbsp;allow you to download all my course content to your computer for offline access.&nbsp;I remember how important this was to me when I was first starting out. Enjoy!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>We dig deeper</strong></p><p>You won’t just learn a few pieces of code, you will also learn the fundamentals of programming itself. This is important as all programming languages are built from the same foundation. Learning core concepts of JavaScript will put you on the path of becoming an Grandmaster programmer in any language.</p><p>You will learn why things work and not just how. Understanding the fundamentals of JavaScript is important as it will allow you to write more complicated code. And trust me, every programming encounters bugs, and without understanding the fundamentals you will be totally lost.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Practice makes perfect</strong></p><p>Theory is theory … but there’s nothing like getting behind your computer and typing in code. That’s why we will be coding, laughing and pulling out our hair together as we code real life websites and exercises during this course.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is this course for you?</strong></p><p>If you fit in any of these categories then this course is perfect for you:</p><p><strong>Student #1:</strong> You want to dabble in the world of programming: learning the fundamentals of JavaScript will allow you to extend this knowledge to any language</p><p><strong>Student #2:</strong> You want to gain a deep understanding of JavaScript, the world’s most popular scripting language</p><p><strong>Student #3:</strong> You want to start using frameworks like Angular or Node.js, which are heavily dependent on JavaScript</p><p><strong>Student #4:</strong> You kinda know what JavaScript is, but have little knowledge about how it works behind the scenes, and how to practically implement it in your code</p><p><strong>Student #5:</strong> You have taken other courses in JavaScript but just don’t feel like you’ve grasped it</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What do you get?</strong></p><p>· Lifetime access to all tutorial videos. No fees or monthly subscriptions.</p><p>· *** Watch videos offline by being able to download them. Many courses don't allow this, but I do as I know how useful it can be. </p><p>· Q&amp;A support.</p><p>· Quizzes and challenges to help you learn.</p><p><br></p><p>Let's get excited about becoming a professional in JavaScript, and to be able to confidently apply it to your website. </p><p><br></p><p>See you in class.</p>|software, website, web, programmers, scripting, websites, programmer, webpage, browser, javascript

So in this course, I created videos lectures in such a way that, a beginner will become a good front-end web designer, if he/she take an interest, do hard work, and practices. </p><p>You know, web designing is the process of creating or designing a website using different skills like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, etc. There are different skills you have to learn if you take part in the website creating field. As in this course, we have added lectures that are very necessary for a student.</p><p><strong>What is included in this web designing master classes course:</strong></p><p><strong>HTML: </strong>HTML is the hypertext markup language which is a basic and fundamental web language to create an abasic of website. For example, if you want to create a basic structure, insert any media field like image, video, or audios, or contouring width &amp; height, or create and control text-based content, all these activities are done with writing code in HTML. </p><p><strong>CSS:</strong> CSS is the cascading style sheet, which has responsibility for website look, beauty, and attraction. We cannot use only HTML for website creation, we need to learn CSS, which is must not optional. Because without HTML we cannot create a website using CSS and without CSS we cannot work with HTML. Because attraction, beauty, and good design of a website is the basic unit of a successful website. There are different topics you will learn in CSS classes like Margin &amp; Padding, Animation, Text Effects, Transforms 2d and 3D, Dropdown menu, etc</p><p><strong>JavaScript: </strong>Javascript is the programming language that is used to control the front end of a website. It is a famous and necessary web language that is taught by all instructors on online or offline platforms. There is powerful functionality we can get using JS with simple and easy code like HTML element controlling using DOM, Form validation, etc.</p><p><strong>SEO</strong>: SEO is search engine optimization if you want to rank your website legally to all over the world to the audience. You have to market you have to do market for your website legally. So SEO is the technique that follows the legal way to rank or optimize your website in search engines. It is the basic rule of SEO, that you have to create a website in which way that, it should be liked by the search engines as well as your audience. So the website should be user-friendly as well as search engine friendly.</p><p><strong>I update all course regularly, so you can ask any question at any time, if there is any issue with understanding any topic, I can create another version of a lecture that clear your concept. </strong></p><p>Thank you and do hard work!</p>|web, lectures, videos, javascript, website, html, classes, online, instructors, updating

It can be as simple as making a static text-based website or as elaborate as developing an interactive dynamic website. You can break web development into two different categories: frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side). Frontend code executes on the user's computer. This can include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Backend code runs on the server — this commonly includes communicating with a database and often involves languages like Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP. Web development does not necessarily include the design process — it focuses on code. A web designer builds wireframes to mockup their vision for a website and then shares that with a developer. The developer is responsible for writing the code that implements the design.</p><p><strong>What are the steps to becoming a web developer?</strong></p><p>Some web developers will obtain a degree or certification in the field. However, most jobs don't require a specific degree or level of education, just demonstrated knowledge of the field. So, it is more important that you know how to show off your skills. You could highlight your skills through relevant work experience or a portfolio of past projects. You might also share code you have developed using a platform like GitHub, or participate in solution-based forums like StackOverflow that reward you for helping others. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the first three coding languages you'll need to learn to break into web development. You need these three essential elements to create a modern website and work as a frontend web developer. HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) specifies the content of the website and builds the backbone. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles the content. JavaScript controls the interactive elements of the website.</p><p><strong>How long does it take to become a web developer?</strong></p><p>The answer to this question will depend on you. The more time you spend developing your skills, the faster you can become a web developer. The good news is that web development generally uses light-weight code that is easier to learn than many other languages. If dedicated, you can learn the basics of web development in a couple of months. But good web developers never stop learning. A better question might be, What can I do to become a better web developer faster? The answer to this question is practice. Becoming familiar with coding helps tremendously, but there is also a less obvious benefit of practicing. The more you code, the more you will run into problems or find bugs in your code. A significant aspect of web development is solving problems and debugging code. The better you get at solving problems and tracking down bugs, the faster you will get at coding.</p><p><strong>What is JavaScript?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is a curly-braced, dynamically typed, prototype-based, object-oriented programming language. It started as the programming language for the web and is one of the three layers of standard web technologies — the other two being HTML and CSS. JavaScript allows you to create and control content dynamically on a web page without requiring a page reload. Web browsers are able to interpret it, and when triggered by events, modify the HTML and CSS of a web page with dynamic updates. JavaScript also uses asynchronous calls to fetch data from web services in the background. Although it was initially only used in web browsers, JavaScript engines have since been put to use as servers with Node.js, included in desktop application frameworks like Electron, and embedded in phone frameworks like Apache Cordova.</p><p><strong>Why is JavaScript important?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is the programming language that allows users to interact with the websites that they're visiting, making it a very important language for web developers to know. In the past, most developers focused on the backend; JavaScript was only relevant when they needed to use visual effects. As web development evolved and the focus shifted towards user experience, programmers started to rely on JavaScript for their frontend code heavily. Today, most sites use JavaScript to fetch and submit data, use logic, and generate HTML in browsers. JavaScript can also communicate asynchronously with data servers in the background without interrupting the user interaction in the foreground. These features make JavaScript not only an important language but a necessary language for modern web development.</p><p><strong>What is HTML and why is it important?</strong></p><p>HTML stands for hyper-text markup language. Whether on a mobile device or a computer, every website that you browse is designed with HTML. HTML isn’t a “programming language,” but rather a “formatting language.” It tells a browser how to display text, images, and other media elements. When HTML was first developed, it was fairly simple. For example, the text on a page could be bolded, italicized, or underlined, and images could be resized and aligned. Today, HTML is much more complex and dynamic, allowing front-end developers to create any layout or setup they desire.</p><p><strong>Why is CSS and Javascript important for HTML?</strong></p><p>HTML is a formatting language, not a programming language. Javascript is often necessary to make HTML “dynamic.” While HTML can make it so that text is displayed on the screen, Javascript can update this text or make it move. Javascript is used for both front-end and back-end development, hand-in-hand with HTML, to create complex and attractive web designs. Meanwhile, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are used to organize the look and feel of a website and make the website easier to update and manipulate. Today, HTML, CSS, and Javascript are frequently used to develop responsive web designs — designs that react to a user’s environment for a better user experience.</p><p><strong>What is Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)?</strong></p><p>CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used to style markup language. Markup languages include HTML, XHML, XML, and other XML-based languages. The most common use of CSS is to style HTML web pages. Although HTML doesn't need CSS to function, every web page would look the same without it. With CSS, you can target specific elements in a web page and change the look and arrangement on the page. CSS can make an embedded image small or cover the entire webpage as a background. You can enlarge a heading and apply a specific font to stand out from the rest of the page. Other things you can do with CSS include changing the color of elements, making elements float to one side of the page, and the list goes on. Every web page uses HTML, and every web page that has its unique look uses CSS.</p><p><strong>What careers use CSS?</strong></p><p>CSS applies to any career that involves web development. Web designers create the templates, mockups, and styles for a website using HTML and CSS that web developers use to build websites. Front-end web developers use CSS with HTML and JavaScript to build front-end web applications that run in the browser. Fullstack web developers create both the part of a web application that runs in the browser and on the server and need to know CSS to make the front-end look good. Content managers may need to know CSS to apply custom styles to articles they publish through a content management system like WordPress. Other job titles that may require you to know CSS include junior web developer, social media manager, website editor, content editor, website project manager, website support specialist, and webmaster.</p><p><strong>What is React Native?</strong></p><p>Created by Facebook, React Native is an open-source-based mobile application framework that uses only JavaScript, making it capable of supporting both Android and iOS platforms. React, also known as React.js, saves time and effort for developers since they only need one programming language. The Native element allows developers to create JavaScript components to design software programs that run on various devices and platforms, such as smartphones, smart TVs, and laptops. With React Native, developers use the same concepts used in the original React framework to design a rich mobile user interface (UI) for various environments from existing components.</p><p><strong>What careers use React Native?</strong></p><p>Businesses that want to create mobile apps for iOS and Android simultaneously to ensure a seamless rollout need developers with a background in React Native. Careers in mobile app development that rely on React Native can count on professionals who can design and build stunning UIs in multiple platforms since it works hand-in-hand with platforms like Windows and tvOS. React Native developers are also vital to helping iOS, and Android companies update and otherwise modernize their apps with features like push notifications and animation for better effectiveness for mobile app subscribers. Developers with a background in React Native might work in full-stack development, designing and refining web-based games, websites, mobile apps, and more.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and Google Flutter?</strong></p><p>Google Flutter offers developers a UI toolkit that has some similarities to React Native. Flutter also has a native component and compiles web, mobile, and desktop applications from a single collection of source codes. Relying on existing code, Flutter is also a free and open-source framework for developers. Until this point, the two frameworks might sound similar. However, React Native is based on and only uses JavaScript, while Flutter only has a loose connection to the language. Google Flutter primarily uses a new language called Dart. Other differences between the two involve sourcing the tool itself and the installation process, setup and configuration, UI component and development, and community support.</p><p><strong>What is React?</strong></p><p>React is a front-end library in Javascript that was developed by Facebook. The simplest definition of React is that it is a user interface library used for building UI components for the web. But if that was all React did, it would be little more than a template library. Developers define components in React by using an HTML-like syntax called JSX. These encapsulated components manage their own state, making it simple to pass rich data to a component and keep the state of the application and its components out of the Document Object Model (DOM). These features give React components the ability to react dynamically and efficiently to changes in their state. A set of simple components in React can be composed into either simple single-page applications or large, complex web applications.</p><p><strong>What is React used for?</strong></p><p>React is an open-source JavaScript frontend library. Some developers consider it a frontend framework because it does more than standard libraries usually do. The most common use of React is to build dynamic user interfaces for single-page web applications. But the structure of React makes it useful for more than just creating websites. JSX, which is one feature of React, is a syntax extension for Javascript that provides a template for the HTML and manages the state of the element. But JSX can be used as an interface for things other than HTML. React Native uses React to build mobile applications. Here, JSX becomes an interface for mobile UIs instead of HTML. There are even a few libraries that use React and JSX to interact with and manage hardware like React Hardware.</p><p><strong>What is Node.Js and what is it used for?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is a server environment built for fast and easily scalable network applications. It was built on Chrome’s JavaScript runtime and uses an event-driven, non-blocking model that makes it the best fit for applications that run on distributed devices and need to run in real-time. By using JavaScript, node.Js can be put to work by many software developers familiar with JavaScript. Because the code is open-source, you can also use it on any platform (Mac OS, Windows, or Linux). Node.js is the architecture for creating websites and real-time applications because it’s easy for teams to learn, and it’s fast. Examples of applications that use node.Js include video conferencing apps, chat servers, eCommerce software, and collaborative online gaming.</p><p><strong>What are the advantages of Node.Js?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is open-source, meaning it’s free code for all developers. On top of that, it also means that there is a thriving community of Node.Js users and programmers that all add to the knowledge base. Many are happy to share their flavor of the code with other developers, and collectively, the Node.Js environment continues to be enhanced. Because Node.Js uses JavaScript, there is a large pool of developers that understand and can code in the environment. It’s also a relatively simple environment for new team members to learn, making it an efficient choice for development teams with people that need training. Node.Js was developed on Push technology instead of web sockets, which is why it’s the preferred choice for real-time communication applications and programs that need to be highly scalable.</p><p><strong>What does it mean that Node.Js is a runtime system?</strong></p><p>A runtime system is a platform where a software program runs. It’s essentially an environment housing the collection of software and hardware that allows an application to execute (or run). Node.Js is a runtime system because it provides the environment necessary for applications to run within it, and no additional code or hardware is required. Because Node.Js makes use of JavaScript, it’s a runtime system that provides a framework where you can use JavaScript to create and run programs. The JavaScript programming language (which is quite popular) is then automatically translated into machine code for the hardware to run the program in real-time. It’s an efficient system, making it the preferred choice for many software and tech companies.<br><strong><br>No prior knowledge is needed!</strong></p><p><strong>Why would you want to take this course?</strong></p><p>Our answer is simple: The quality of teaching.</p><p>When you enroll, you will feel our seasoned instructors' expertise.</p><p><strong>Video and Audio Production Quality</strong></p><p>All our videos are created/produced as <strong>high-quality video and audio</strong> to provide you the best learning experience.</p><p>You will be,</p><ul><li><p>Seeing clearly</p></li><li><p>Hearing clearly</p></li><li><p>Moving through the course without distractions</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>You'll also get:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Lifetime Access to The Course</p></li><li><p>Fast &amp; Friendly Support in the Q&amp;A section</p></li><li><p>Udemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download</p></li></ul><p>Dive in now </p><p><strong>Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp with MERN Stack Projects</strong></p><p>We offer <strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions.</p><p>See you in the course!</p>|browsers, browser, nodejs, apps, bootcamp, webmaster, html, html5, stackoverflow, javascript

The good news is since the <strong>Free and popular tools are used</strong> you don’t need to buy any tool or application.</p><p><strong>What is React?</strong></p><p>React is a front-end library in Javascript that was developed by Facebook. The simplest definition of React is that it is a user interface library used for building UI components for the web. But if that was all React did, it would be little more than a template library. Developers define components in React by using an HTML-like syntax called JSX. These encapsulated components manage their own state, making it simple to pass rich data to a component and keep the state of the application and its components out of the Document Object Model (DOM). These features give React components the ability to react dynamically and efficiently to changes in their state. A set of simple components in React can be composed into either simple single-page applications or large, complex web applications.</p><p><strong>What is React used for?</strong></p><p>React is an open-source JavaScript frontend library. Some developers consider it a frontend framework because it does more than standard libraries usually do. The most common use of React is to build dynamic user interfaces for single-page web applications. But the structure of React makes it useful for more than just creating websites. JSX, which is one feature of React, is a syntax extension for Javascript that provides a template for the HTML and manages the state of the element. But JSX can be used as an interface for things other than HTML. React Native uses React to build mobile applications. Here, JSX becomes an interface for mobile UIs instead of HTML. There are even a few libraries that use React and JSX to interact with and manage hardware like React Hardware.</p><p><strong>How does React work?</strong></p><p>React encourages engineers to write code using a Functional Programming approach. Engineers create components, which are normal Javascript functions. These functions return information to tell React what content should be displayed on the screen. The real power of React comes from the ability to nest or compose these functions inside of one another. This nesting ability encourages code reuse and allows an engineer to write a component a single time, but in many different places.</p><p><strong>Is React a framework or library?</strong></p><p>Frameworks provide an opinionated approach to building an entire application. Libraries, on the other hand, assist in building a single aspect of an application. With this in mind, React is a library. It assists engineers in presenting HTML in the browser. React has no opinions on how data is fetched, how styling is applied, or how the app is deployed or built.</p><p><strong>Is React worth learning?</strong></p><p>Yes, React is worth learning. There are a couple of reasons. The first one is that React is in high demand in the software development job market and has been for a few years. If you learn to code in React and can do it well, you will increase your chances of finding a job. This alone is another reason it is worth learning. Website users no longer will settle for old-fashioned sites that won't update without a page reload. React’s method of dynamically updating the HTML of a web page fits these users' needs and improves their experience. React has also been around a few years and has stood the test of time. A large portion of websites, both small and large, use React as a frontend framework.</p><p><strong>Is React hard to learn?</strong></p><p>Every technology or programming language has a learning curve, and React is no different. But it is easy to learn if you are dedicated and determined to create frontend web applications. To make learning React simpler, you should stick to the basics of React before you add any extra libraries, as that will only complicate your learning experience in the beginning. Since React is a Javascript framework, a solid grounding in Javascript will give you a head start. With this knowledge, the unique concept of JSX, React's templating language, and the way React uses state will be much easier to grasp.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and ReactJS, and which one should I learn?</strong></p><p>React, or React JS, is a front-end Javascript library for building UI components for the web. If you are interested in web development, React is the perfect library to learn to create interactive, dynamic single-page apps, or even full-scale web applications. React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications for both the Android phone and Apple's iPhone. React Native is still React, which means the syntax and workflow for building applications are basically the same, but the generated components are different. In React, web components are generated. In React Native, the generated components interact with a phone's native APIs. If your focus is web development, then you should learn React. If you want to build mobile applications, it is best to learn React first and become familiar with the technology before you try React Native.</p><p><strong>What is React Native?</strong></p><p>Created by Facebook, React Native is an open-source-based mobile application framework that uses only JavaScript, making it capable of supporting both Android and iOS platforms. React, also known as React.js, saves time and effort for developers since they only need one programming language. The Native element allows developers to create JavaScript components to design software programs that run on various devices and platforms, such as smartphones, smart TVs, and laptops. With React Native, developers use the same concepts used in the original React framework to design a rich mobile user interface (UI) for various environments from existing components.</p><p><strong>What careers use React Native?</strong></p><p>Businesses that want to create mobile apps for iOS and Android simultaneously to ensure a seamless rollout need developers with a background in React Native. Careers in mobile app development that rely on React Native can count on professionals who can design and build stunning UIs in multiple platforms since it works hand-in-hand with platforms like Windows and tvOS. React Native developers are also vital to helping iOS, and Android companies update and otherwise modernize their apps with features like push notifications and animation for better effectiveness for mobile app subscribers. Developers with a background in React Native might work in full-stack development, designing and refining web-based games, websites, mobile apps, and more.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and Google Flutter?</strong></p><p>Google Flutter offers developers a UI toolkit that has some similarities to React Native. Flutter also has a native component and compiles web, mobile, and desktop applications from a single collection of source codes. Relying on existing code, Flutter is also a free and open-source framework for developers. Until this point, the two frameworks might sound similar. However, React Native is based on and only uses JavaScript, while Flutter only has a loose connection to the language. Google Flutter primarily uses a new language called Dart. Other differences between the two involve sourcing the tool itself and the installation process, setup and configuration, UI component and development, and community support.</p><p><strong>Why is React so popular?</strong></p><p>There are many reasons why React is popular. One reason is that Facebook developed it. The social proof is that if it is good enough for Facebook, one of the most popular social networks on the web, it should be good enough for other applications. React also solved many of the past issues that developers had with developing single-page applications (SPAs). React came out when SPAs were becoming popular, and all the existing frameworks to build them made development complicated and prone to bugs. One feature that makes it better than past libraries is that React is relatively easy to use. Its components are reusable, plus React's use of the virtual DOM makes it very performant. React should remain popular in the future as each new release brings new features and performance improvements.</p><p><strong>What is Node.Js and what is it used for?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is a server environment built for fast and easily scalable network applications. It was built on Chrome’s JavaScript runtime and uses an event-driven, non-blocking model that makes it the best fit for applications that run on distributed devices and need to run in real-time. By using JavaScript, node.Js can be put to work by many software developers familiar with JavaScript. Because the code is open-source, you can also use it on any platform (Mac OS, Windows, or Linux). Node.js is the architecture for creating websites and real-time applications because it’s easy for teams to learn, and it’s fast. Examples of applications that use node.Js include video conferencing apps, chat servers, eCommerce software, and collaborative online gaming.</p><p><strong>What are the advantages of Node.Js?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is open-source, meaning it’s free code for all developers. On top of that, it also means that there is a thriving community of Node.Js users and programmers that all add to the knowledge base. Many are happy to share their flavor of the code with other developers, and collectively, the Node.Js environment continues to be enhanced. Because Node.Js uses JavaScript, there is a large pool of developers that understand and can code in the environment. It’s also a relatively simple environment for new team members to learn, making it an efficient choice for development teams with people that need training. Node.Js was developed on Push technology instead of web sockets, which is why it’s the preferred choice for real-time communication applications and programs that need to be highly scalable.</p><p><strong>What does it mean that Node.Js is a runtime system?</strong></p><p>A runtime system is a platform where a software program runs. It’s essentially an environment housing the collection of software and hardware that allows an application to execute (or run). Node.Js is a runtime system because it provides the environment necessary for applications to run within it, and no additional code or hardware is required. Because Node.Js makes use of JavaScript, it’s a runtime system that provides a framework where you can use JavaScript to create and run programs. The JavaScript programming language (which is quite popular) is then automatically translated into machine code for the hardware to run the program in real-time. It’s an efficient system, making it the preferred choice for many software and tech companies.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Video and Audio Production Quality</strong></p><p>All our videos are created/produced as <strong>high-quality video and audio</strong> to provide you the best learning experience.</p><p>You will be,</p><ul><li><p>Seeing clearly</p></li><li><p>Hearing clearly</p></li><li><p>Moving through the course without distractions</p></li></ul><p><strong>You'll also get:</strong></p><p>Lifetime Access to The Course</p><p>Fast &amp; Friendly Support in the Q&amp;A section</p><p>Udemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download</p><p>Dive in now to our <strong>Full Stack Web &amp; Mobile App Development | Mern Stack Project </strong>course.</p><p>We offer <strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions.</p><p>See you in the course!</p>|strong, react, js, stack, development, mongodb, nodejs, web, mobile, app

What is a serverless function and why should we care? So, here is the deal. There are times when our app needs a dynamic feature and even after that 20th google search, we inevitably come to realization that the only way do it, is by building and hosting our own server. A good example would be setting up a stripe payment flow. There is a better solution though. </p><p><strong><em>Serverless Functions.</em></strong></p><p>Ok, but what is a serverless function? Well, despite the name, serverless function actually does not mean that there is no server. What it simply means, is that someone else is responsible for maintaining it . We, as front-end developers only need to setup our desired functionality, and the cloud provider will take care of the rest. What also really cool, we can continue to use our favorite programming language – Javascript. Most cloud providers offer some solution of serverless functions but for this course we will hosting company by the name of Netlify. We will use Netlify because they offer generous free tier and make it very easy,&nbsp; to get up and running with serverless functions.</p><p>Here are the serverless functions examples/setups were are going to cover during the course.</p><p>- Basic “Hello World”</p><p>- Basic API (with local data)</p><p>- Complex API (with Airtable)</p><p>- Survey</p><p>- Open Weather API</p><p>- Newsletter</p><p>- Send Email / Submit Form</p><p>- Stripe Payment</p>|hosting, newsletter, netlify, developers, app, server, javascript, email, serverless, google

What is a NodeJS? And even though there are plenty of good answers out there the one that I like the most is this one -<strong> NodeJS is an environment to run Javascript outside of the Browser. </strong>NodeJS was created in 2009 and it's built on top of Chrome's V8 Javascript Engine.&nbsp;As you are probably aware of, every browser has an engine, a tool that compiles our code down to machine code and Chrome uses one by the name of V8. Since the moment it was created, Node has evolved tremendously, and while there are many things to like about Node, some of the main ones are - large community, since that tremendously saves time on feature development, as well as the fact that with the help of Node, it's never been easier to build Full-Stack Apps, since both Front-End And Back-End are built in one language, and you guessed that language is our beloved Javascript. </p><p>During the course we will cover&nbsp; following main technologies - NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT and many smaller ones as well. </p><p>Course consists of </p><p>- Node Tutorial</p><p>- Express Tutorial</p><p>- <strong>Projects</strong></p><p>- Task Manager&nbsp;API</p><p>- Store API</p><p>- JWT Basics</p><p>- Jobs&nbsp;API</p><p>- File Upload</p><p>- Send Email</p><p>- Stripe Payment</p><p>- E-Commerce API</p><p>- Email Workflow</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>|technologies, email, nodejs, tutorial, v8, chrome, 2009, apps, browser, javascript

We also learn about the Boolean operators such as the logical AND &amp; OR. Finally we will learn how to loop through a given set of instructions using the for, while &amp; the do-while loop.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 4: Arrays &amp; Objects.</strong></p><p>In this section we will what are arrays and how the array data structures could be created in JavaScript. We will learn the different ways of creating an array, and along with it, we will also learn different array methods which can be used to manipulate data inside of an array. After arrays, we now move on to learn what are objects and how data and methods can be contained inside an object. We will learn how to create, access, manipulate &amp; delete properties inside of a JavaScript object.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 5: Functional Programming In JavaScript.</strong></p><p>Once we know enough JavaScript to write basic programs, its now time to learn how to write code in a proper way by creating functions. In this section we will learn how to write modular and well maintained code using functions. We will learn how to define and call functions in JavaScript and the different ways to creating or declaring a function like the modern arrow notation. Along with it we will also learn how to make a function accept arguments and return values. We will also learn about functional scope and lexical scope and learn how it affects the variables defined inside a function.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 6: JavaScript Document Object Model: DOM &amp; DOM Events.</strong></p><p>This section covers how to use JavaScript to control the document object model which helps us to manipulate elements on our webpage. We learn how to get access to every element on our webpage by using different methods. Once we have access to these elements we could easily manipulate, create and delete them using different methods provided. After completing this section, we could now manipulate almost any element on our webpage. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 7: Object Oriented Programming In JavaScript.</strong></p><p>Object oriented programming is another way of writing code just as functional programming is. In this section we will learn how to write JavaScript code the OOP way. We will first understand what object oriented programming actually means, the advantages of using OOP over functional programming and then jump into learning different terminologies and implement them by writing code. We will learn what are classes, how to create them. How to create or derive objects from classes, how to access data and methods form objects etc. Along with it we also learn how to perform inheritance between multiple classes and also cover concepts such as prototypes.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 8: Front-End Web&nbsp;Development With Vue.</strong></p><p>In this section we learn the VueJS library right form scratch. We will learn all the basics of the Vue library and learn how these concepts can be put to practice to build interactive interfaces for our websites &amp; web applications. We will learn how different elements on our webpages can be made reactive by attaching them to the data such that they change with&nbsp; changes in data. We will also learn how to use Vue components to modularize the front end of our application.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 9: Building A Todo App With Vue &amp; JavaScript .</strong></p><p>Now that we know how to use Vue to power our applications, its now time to put our knowledge into practice. In this section we will build a fully functional Todo List application entirely in Vue which is capable of performing create, read, update &amp; delete operations on data also known as CRUD.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 10: Building A Calculator App With Vue &amp; JavaScript .</strong></p><p>Vue is best suited for SPAs or single page applications. Hence in this section we build a fully functional browser based calculator app that performs operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, finding percentage etc.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 11: Back End Programming With Node &amp; JavaScript.</strong></p><p>The best part about JavaScript is that you can use it both at the front as well as the back end. As we have already learned how to use JavaScript in the front-end now its time to use it in the back-end. In this section we will learn how to use JavaScript to program servers using NodeJS which is a JavaScript runtime. We will learn what NodeJS is and how it allows us to run JavaScript in the backend. We will lean NodeJS right from the basics such as accessing the file system, reading from and writing to files, creating directories etc. We will also learn how to create our very own server which is capable of handling incoming client request and render dynamic HTML pages as a response. We will also learn Express, which is a NodeJS framework that makes things such as rendering webpages and routing for our web applications easier. We will also cover different templating engines such as EJS &amp; Mustache to create and render HTML templates.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 12: Integrating MySQL Database With JavaScript Web Apps:</strong></p><p>While building web applications, we want the data to persist so that it can later be retrieved. To do so we need our data to be saved in our database. Hence in this section we will learn how to setup database for our Node &amp; Express applications so that the data for our applications persist. We will learn how to connect databases with our JavaScript apps and how to make our app query and manipulate data from the database.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 13: Building A Chat Application With Socket io &amp; NodeJS.</strong></p><p>In this section we will learn how multiple clients can be connected to a single server via using sockets. We will learn this by building a chat application which consists of one server and multiple clients. We program the server using NodeJS and&nbsp; a library called as socket io. Using which we build a server that can broadcast messages received from one client to multiple other.</p><p>_________________________________________________________________________</p><p>So let's begin the journey of becoming an <strong>expert in JavaScript.</strong></p><p>In addition to the <strong>Udemy</strong> <strong>30-day money back guarantee</strong>, you have my personal guarantee that you will love what you learn in this course.

3959106|Backend Master Class [Golang + Postgres + Kubernetes + gRPC]|999|/course/backend-master-class-golang-postgresql-kubernetes/|frontend|0|4.7|en|TECH SCHOOL|<p>In this course, you will learn step-by-step how to design, develop and deploy a backend web service from scratch. I believe the best way to learn programming is to build a real application. Therefore, throughout the course, you will learn how to build a backend web service for a simple bank. It will provide APIs for the frontend to do the following things:</p><ul><li><p>Create and manage bank accounts.</p></li><li><p>Record all balance changes to each of the accounts.</p></li><li><p>Perform a money transfer between 2 accounts.</p></li></ul><p>The programming language we will use to develop the service is Golang, but the course is not just about coding in Go. The course is divided into 4 main parts: </p><ol><li><p>In the first part, you will learn deeply about how to design the database, generate codes to talk to the DB in a consistent and reliable way using transactions, understand the DB&nbsp;isolation levels, and how to use it correctly in production. Besides the database, you will also learn how to use docker for local development, how to use Git to manage your codes, and how to use Github Action to run unit tests automatically.</p></li><li><p>In the second part, you will learn how to build a set of RESTful HTTP&nbsp;APIs&nbsp;using Gin - one of the most popular Golang frameworks for building web services. This includes everything from loading app configs, mocking DB for more robust unit tests, handling errors, authenticating users, and securing the APIs with JWT and PASETO&nbsp;access tokens.&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>In the third part, you will learn how to build your app with Docker and deploy it to a production Kubernetes cluster on AWS. The lectures are very detailed with a step-by-step guide, from how to build a minimal docker image, set up a free-tier AWS account, create a production database, store and retrieve production secrets, create a Kubernetes cluster with EKS, use Github Action to automatically build and deploy the image to the EKS cluster, buy a domain name and route the traffics to the service, secure the connection with HTTPs and auto-renew TLS certificate from Let's Encrypt.</p></li><li><p>The last part is a work-in-progress, where we discuss more advanced backend topics such as managing user sessions, building gRPC APIs, using gRPC gateway to serve both gRPC and HTTP with 1 single implementation of the handler, embedding Swagger documentation as part of the backend service, running asynchronous workers, gracefully shutdown servers, etc. We will keep making and uploading new videos, so please come back here to check them out from time to time.</p></li></ol><p>This course is designed with a lot of details, so that everyone, even with very little programming experience can understand and do it by themselves. I strongly believe that after the course, you would be able to work much more confidently and effectively on your projects.</p>|web, encrypt, learn, lectures, bank, database, tests, coding, programming, build

461160|Learn and Understand NodeJS|1099|/course/understand-nodejs/|frontend|0|4.6|en|Anthony Alicea|<p>NodeJS is a rapidy growing web server technology, and Node developers are among the highest paid in the industry. Knowing NodeJS well will get you a job or improve your current one by enabling you to build high quality, robust web applications.</p><p>In this course you will gain a deep understanding of Node, learn how NodeJS works under the hood, and how that knowledge helps you avoid common pitfalls and <em>drastically improve your ability to debug problems</em>. </p><p>In this course we'll look at <strong>how the C++ written V8 Javascript engine works and how NodeJS uses it to expand the abilities of Javascript</strong>. You'll learn how to structure your code for reuse and to be easier to understand, manage, and expand using <strong>modules and understand how modules really work</strong>.</p><p>You'll learn <strong>how asynchronous code works in Node and the Node event loop</strong>, as well as how to use the <strong>event emitter, streams, buffers, pipes, and work with files</strong>. We'll see how that leads to <strong>building a web server in Node</strong>. </p><p>We'll dive into<strong> web sites, web apps and APIs with Express</strong> and learn how Express can save us time as Node developers.</p><p>You'll also gain an understanding of <strong>npm, connecting to databases, and the MEAN stack</strong>!</p><p>During it all you'll gain a deep understanding of the Javascript concepts and other computer science concepts that power Node.</p><p>NodeJS doesn't have to be hard to learn. The biggest mistake most coding tutorials make is expecting someone to learn simply by imitating others' code. Real world situations are never exactly like the tutorial.</p><p>I believe the best way to learn is to understand how a tool works and what it does for you, look at examples, and then try it yourself. That's how this course is built, with the goal to help you both learn and understand NodeJS.</p><p><em>Note: In this course you'll also get </em><strong><em>downloadable source code</em></strong><em>. You will often be provided with 'starter' code, giving you the base for you to start writing your code, and 'finished' code to compare your code to.</em></p>|hard, robust, developers, apps, highest, high, science, strong, biggest, javascript

Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or garbage collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages.</p><p><strong>What is WebAssembly?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>WebAssembly is a new type of code that can be run in modern web browsers — it is a low-level assembly-like language with a compact binary format that runs with near-native performance and provides languages such as C/C++, C#, and Rust with a compilation target so that they can run on the web. It is also designed to run alongside JavaScript, allowing both to work together.</p><p><strong>Is this course right for you?</strong></p><p>If you plan to start your career as a developer or improve your programming skills, this course is right for you. Learn how to build a browser game with minimal JS and Rust code compiled into WebAssembly instructions.</p><p>You will get the confidence and skills required to start your projects during this course. In addition, you will get the right mindset to apply for a developer career.</p><p><strong>What are you going to work on?</strong></p><p>You will build the Snake game from scratch. You will learn to write code in Rust language, static type, compiled language.</p><p>The course starts with an explanation and practical examples of the Rust language. You will learn Rust-specific features such as moving and copying</p><p>Rust doesn't have a garbage collector. Memory is cleared when the values are getting out of the scope. You will learn how to manage this concept with ease.</p><p>The next feature you will learn of is borrowing and references. Through references, you will be able to access values without owning them.</p><p>In the beginning lectures, we will also talk about memory management in Stack and the Heap structures, modularity, strings, and other essential topics.</p><p>After Rust's introduction lectures, you will start building your Snake game. You will learn how to structure the application modular and cleanly.&nbsp;</p><p>You will build your own JS frontend, exposed through a simple Webpack development server. Later, you will transform JS implementation into TS (Typescript). This will specify types and be on the same page as Rust code.</p><p>You will build your rust backend code, the backbone of our game. You will learn how to compile Rust code into WebAssembly code. WebAssembly is code that can run in the browser. It's faster (almost Native speed) and more efficient than JS.</p><p>At the end of the course, we will create a production server and deploy our game to Heroku, so anybody on the internet can play our game.</p>|modular, web, modern, internet, efficient, easily, browsers, webpack, browser, javascript

Our real-world experts can lead you through hands-on projects to apply your skills.</p><p><strong>JavaScript</strong> is a text-based computer programming language used to make dynamic web pages. A must-learn for aspiring <strong>web developers or programmers</strong>, <strong>JavaScript </strong>can be used for features like image carousels, displaying countdowns and timers, and playing media on a webpage. With JavaScript online classes, you can learn to build interactive web applications, choose the best framework, and work with other programming languages like <strong>HTML and CSS.</strong></p><p><strong>JavaScript </strong>is a curly-braced, dynamically typed, prototype-based, object-oriented programming language. It started as the programming language for the web and is one of the three layers of standard web technologies — the other two being <strong>HTML </strong>and <strong>CSS</strong>. JavaScript allows you to create and control content dynamically on a web page without requiring a page reload. </p><p>Whether you’re interested in mastering responsive web design, creating WordPress templates using Bootstrap, or integrating Bootstrap with <strong>HTML5</strong>, and <strong>CSS3</strong>, Oak Academy has a top-rated course to help you achieve your goals.</p><p><strong>Bootstrap </strong>is a free <strong>frontend web development</strong> framework for creating responsive websites. <strong>Bootstrap </strong>promotes a mobile-first approach to web design, offering a suite of templates and components that automatically render for use on any device.</p><p><strong>HTML</strong>, or hypertext markup language, is computer code used to create web pages and emails. Web developers, email marketers, web writers, and many others use <strong>HTML</strong>. Whether on a <strong>mobile device</strong> or a <strong>computer</strong>, every website that you browse is designed with <strong>HTML</strong>. </p><p><strong>HTML </strong>isn’t a “programming language,” but rather a “formatting language.” It tells a browser how to display text, images, and other media elements.</p><p>Learning how to code <strong>HTML </strong>without also learning <strong>CSS </strong>is like learning how to read but not write. All of your hard web development work is lost if you don’t optimize it for different screen sizes. Udemy has top-rated courses to show you how <strong>CSS </strong>helps you do just that.</p><p>Consider the devices that you use to access the internet on a daily basis. You’ll notice that there isn’t a standard screen size. Without CSS, rendering a website’s text, layout, and design for these discrepancies in screens would be impossible. CSS is the backbone of all website styling work, and is rightfully considered a cornerstone of internet technology.</p><p><strong>CSS</strong> or <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong> is a style sheet language used to style markup language. <strong>Markup languages</strong> include <strong>HTML, XHML, XML, and other XML-based</strong> languages. The most common use of CSS is to style HTML web pages. Although HTML doesn't need CSS to function, every web page would look the same without it. With <strong>CSS</strong>, you can target specific elements in a web page and change the look and arrangement on the page. <strong>CSS </strong>can make an embedded image small or cover the entire webpage as a background. You can enlarge a heading and apply a specific font to stand out from the rest of the page.</p><p>In this course you will learn to develop web applications with <strong>Vue JS, Vuex</strong> from scratch.</p><p>If you are thinking to realize your dream web application, this course is for you.</p><p>We have explained <strong>Vue</strong> and <strong>Vuex </strong>from beginner to all levels.

You can also use it to create one-page applications and handle animations, interactive elements, and graphics. Generating projects is also possible with the user-built presets, which is commonly applicable for coders working in enterprise environments. Because it is based on <strong>JavaScript</strong>, you can easily integrate <strong>Vue </strong>into an existing JS project. <strong>Vue </strong>uses the traditional Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which means that the core library of Vue.js focuses on the view layer by default. It enforces a one-way data flow between components. This also makes it easy for you to integrate with other libraries or existing projects. Vue also uses virtual DOM (Document Object Model), which makes it faster than regular DOM. Instead of re-rendering the whole page, Vue only updates the objects that you change.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Vue and React?</strong></p><p>Although <strong>Vue </strong>has an MVC architecture, you cannot use it with a different architectural approach, which differs from the Component Based Architecture (CBA) used in React. They also differ in how they optimize data. When a component’s state changes in React, it triggers the re-render of the entire component sub-tree, starting at that component as the root. Vue automatically tracks a component’s dependencies during its render, so the system knows which components actually need to re-render when the state changes. In React, everything is in <strong>JavaScript</strong>. <strong>Vue</strong>, on the other hand, embraces web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and allows you to build off of them. Another difference between these frameworks is how you can scale up your projects. React only offers a single template that assumes you’re building a single-page application, while <strong>Vue </strong>offers several default options for multiple purposes and build systems.</p><p><strong>Is Vue JS easy to learn?</strong></p><p><strong>Vue JS</strong> can be easy to learn. Unlike other frontend technologies, Vue doesn’t require in-depth knowledge of libraries. If you want to start learning Vue, all you need to have is basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Compared to other coding technologies, developers typically classify <strong>Vue.js</strong> as having an easy learning curve. This is due largely in part to Vue’s reputation for having an elegant programming style and patterns. Because <strong>Vue </strong>is a progressive framework, it makes it easy for you to use it to integrate into an existing project. Because of its familiar templating syntax and use of components, you may find that integrating or migrating existing projects to Vue is fairly straightforward. Vue is known for offering a vast ecosystem of tools and companion libraries, making it a simple framework that you can use to respond to the complex needs of enterprise-grade applications.</p><p><strong>What is Vuex used for?</strong></p><p>Vuex is <strong>a state management pattern + library for Vue.</strong> <strong>js applications</strong>. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion.</p><p><strong>What is difference between Vue and Vuex?</strong></p><p>Vue is a <strong>progressive Javascript framework</strong> and Vuex is the state management tool. We can use redux or flux inside <strong>Vue</strong>, But <strong>Vuex </strong>is native to the Vue.</p><p><strong>Why do I need Vuex?</strong></p><p>Vuex is a popular <strong>way to handle a complex app's authentication in Vue</strong>. With Vuex, you're able to handle the token's availability and access controls and route blocks throughout your app. Mutations, getters, and setters assist with this task.</p><p><strong>How does Vuex store work?</strong></p><p>It works by <strong>having a central store for shared state</strong>, and providing methods to allow any component in your application to access that state. In essence, Vuex ensures your views remain consistent with your application data, regardless of which function triggers a change to your application data.</p><p><strong>When Should I Use It?</strong></p><p>Vuex helps us deal with shared state management with the cost of more concepts and boilerplate. It's a trade-off between short term and long term productivity.</p><p>If you've never built a large-scale SPA and jump right into Vuex, it may feel verbose and daunting. That's perfectly normal- if your app is simple, you will most likely be fine without Vuex. A simple store pattern (opens new window)may be all you need. But if you are building a medium-to-large-scale SPA, chances are you have run into situations that make you think about how to better handle state outside of your Vue components, and Vuex will be the natural next step for you.</p><p><strong>What is JavaScript?</strong></p><p><strong>JavaScript </strong>is a curly-braced, dynamically typed, prototype-based, object-oriented programming language. It started as the programming language for the web and is one of the three layers of standard web technologies — the other two being HTML and CSS. <strong>JavaScript</strong> allows you to create and control content dynamically on a web page without requiring a page reload. Web browsers are able to interpret it, and when triggered by events, modify the HTML and CSS of a web page with dynamic updates. JavaScript also uses asynchronous calls to fetch data from web services in the background. Although it was initially only used in web browsers, JavaScript engines have since been put to use as servers with Node.js, included in desktop application frameworks like Electron, and embedded in phone frameworks like Apache Cordova.</p><p><strong>Why is JavaScript important?</strong></p><p><strong>JavaScript </strong>is the programming language that allows users to interact with the websites that they're visiting, making it a very important language for web developers to know. In the past, most developers focused on the backend; JavaScript was only relevant when they needed to use visual effects. As web development evolved and the focus shifted towards user experience, programmers started to rely on JavaScript for their frontend code heavily. Today, most sites use JavaScript to fetch and submit data, use logic, and generate HTML in browsers. JavaScript can also communicate asynchronously with data servers in the background without interrupting the user interaction in the foreground. <strong>These features make JavaScript not only an important language but a necessary language for modern web development.</strong></p><p><strong>What are the main uses of JavaScript?</strong></p><p><strong>JavaScript </strong>is a text-based programming language used for client- and server-side development. Web developers have used JavaScript since its inception to add simple interactivity to web pages like modals, animated elements, or image slideshows. While that is still one of its primary uses, Javascript has evolved to building complete web applications. SPAs, or single page applications, depend on JavaScript-based frameworks like <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Angular</strong>, and <strong>Vue </strong>to bring a desktop-like application experience to the browser. However, it's important to note that web browsers aren't places that make good use of the programming language. Javascript is also popular for building web services and back-end infrastructure with Node.js. React Native, Xamarin, Ionic, and NativeScript frameworks use JavaScript for developing phone apps as well.</p><p><strong>React vs. Angular vs. Vue: what is the best JavaScript framework?</strong></p><p>Choosing the best <strong>JavaScript</strong> framework for your web project depends on what you are looking for. React is a popular framework, which means you will find a lot of community support if you need help. It is also considered relatively easy to learn but is being developed at a rapid pace. Angular is a framework that makes data binding easy so that you can template an application faster. It also uses the RxJS library to simplify asynchronous programming and Typescript (which compiles to JavaScript) for a cleaner, less error-prone development process. Some cons of Angular are that it can have a steep learning curve and can be complex. Vue is a lightweight framework, so it is easy to learn, very performant, and flexible. Some cons of Vue are limited plugins, and its flexibility can lead to irregular code.</p><p><strong>What is JSON and what is it used for?</strong></p><p>Because of the evolution of the JavaScript language, JavaScript has a variety of techniques for creating objects. But, ultimately in the background, <strong>JavaScript </strong>is using a syntax called <strong>JSON</strong>. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a standard text-based format used to represent objects in JavaScript. The same basic types of data represented in Javascript can also be represented in JSON, including strings, numbers, arrays, booleans, and JavaScript objects. Although JSON is based on the JavaScript object, it is not just used in JavaScript. It is also used as a format to transfer data from a web browser to a server and vice versa because of the format's simplicity and small size. The JSON format is used in REST APIs for this purpose and has replaced XML as the standard format for many APIs. Because of this, just about any language you use will have a method of converting data into JSON to interact with REST APIs.</p><p><strong>What is AJAX and what is it used for?</strong></p><p><strong>AJAX </strong>stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is a technology that developers use to create better, faster and more interactive web applications. AJAX uses XHTML for content, CSS to style the page, and JavaScript for controlling content dynamically. AJAX allows you to update a web page without reloading the page (this technique is called a “SPA” or Single Page Application), request data for the page after it has loaded, receive data after the page has loaded, and send data to the server in the background. Despite XML being part of the acronym that makes up AJAX, AJAX can send and receive data in any format, including JSON or plain text. While traditional web applications use synchronous methods to send and receive information from a web server, AJAX can use asynchronous API calls in the background without blocking activity in the browser. AJAX is a data-driven rather than a page-driven technology.</p><p><strong>How can I teach myself Javascript?</strong></p><p>One of the best ways to learn to write code is through an online course that teaches you how to write JavaScript with an instructor that will explain the code, what versions you should use, and why. Learning to develop a real-world application, with an instructor explaining in a step-by-step fashion, will teach you modern code techniques.</p><p><strong>What is the best IDE for Javascript?</strong></p><p>With all of the different <strong>JavaScript IDEs</strong> available, the best option depends on how you intend to use it, along with your personal preferences. Webstorm is a popular JavaScript IDE from JetBrains. It provides fast static code analysis, integrated testing, local history, code refactoring, and debugging. While the IDE requires a paid subscription, many developers swear by it because of its compatibility with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Those searching for a free option might prefer VS Code. This general-purpose, open-source IDE comes with IntelliSense, Git integration, and debugging features built-in. Many third-party extensions are available to add new language and programming features, making it one of the more flexible choices. Atom is another general-purpose IDE that is popular with JavaScript developers. It is also free, open-source, and has third-party extensions to add functionality.</p><p><strong>What is HTML and why is it important?</strong></p><p><strong>HTML </strong>stands for a hyper-text markup language. Whether on a mobile device or a computer, every website that you browse is designed with HTML. HTML isn’t a “programming language,” but rather a “formatting language.” It tells a browser how to display text, images, and other media elements. When HTML was first developed, it was fairly simple. For example, the text on a page could be bolded, italicized, or underlined, and images could be resized and aligned. Today, HTML is much more complex and dynamic, allowing front-end developers to create any layout or setup they desire.</p><p><strong>Why is CSS and Javascript important for HTML?</strong></p><p><strong>HTML </strong>is a formatting language, not a programming language. Javascript is often necessary to make HTML “dynamic.” While HTML can make it so that text is displayed on the screen, Javascript can update this text or make it move. Javascript is used for both front-end and back-end development, hand-in-hand with HTML, to create complex and attractive web designs. Meanwhile, <strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> are used to organize the look and feel of a website and make the website easier to update and manipulate. Today, HTML, CSS, and Javascript are frequently used to develop responsive web designs — designs that react to a user’s environment for a better user experience.</p><p><strong>What is an HTML element and why is it important?</strong></p><p><strong>HTML </strong>is designed on a modular basis, meaning every part of the web page has a specific “place.” An HTML element is a part of the page. Common HTML elements include “&lt;p&gt;” for a “paragraph” and “&lt;title&gt;” for the “title” of the page. In fact, the entirety of the HTML page is within the “&lt;html&gt;” element. Elements are begun and ended with tags, so a title would be written: “&lt;title&gt;This is the Title to the page.&lt;/title&gt;” Organizing code this way makes it easier to reference and control. Each element may also have characteristics. For instance, the “&lt;p&gt;” (paragraph) tag can be aligned in a certain direction. These are the basic building blocks of HTML and what most designers should learn first.</p><p><strong>Is HTML a programming language?</strong></p><p><strong>HTML </strong>is not considered a programming language but rather a markup or formatting language. This is an important distinction. Formatting languages merely control how things are displayed on a visual level, whereas programming languages are more dynamic; they use logic gates to determine the behavior of a program. But there is some crossover. “DHTML,” for instance, refers to Dynamic HTML. It is a type of HTML augmented by Javascript to make it easier to adjust on the fly. Because HTML, Javascript, and CSS are so frequently used together, they can often be folded together, which can contribute to some confusion regarding whether HTML is a programming language.</p><p><strong>Is HTML hard to learn?</strong></p><p><strong>HTML </strong>is known as one of the easiest languages to learn. It’s also one of the most ubiquitous. Many individuals interested in front-end, back-end, or full-stack development will learn HTML first. While HTML is largely intended for websites as a language, it is also used in many other programs. For example, when you create an email signature, you will usually be using HTML. Emails themselves use a combination of HTML and CSS. An advantage (and an occasional double-edged sword) to HTML is that it is very forgiving. You can get some HTML wrong, and your page will still be displayed, if not exactly how you want it to be.</p><p><strong>What jobs use HTML?</strong></p><p>Nearly any development or design job will require a cursory understanding of HTML. HTML has also evolved dramatically since it was originally developed; it is far more complex and standardized than before. Because of this, even those who have been experts in HTML during their career may need to undergo an HTML refresher periodically. Most jobs that require HTML will involve web design, web development, or layout and design. For example, someone who manages a content management system such as WordPress may not need to know any other programming languages but should still know HTML basics. Similarly, someone who formats online newsletters or an online magazine in an administrative capacity may not need to be a web designer or web developer but might need to understand the principles of HTML.</p><p><strong>What is responsive design?</strong></p><p>Responsive design is a new type of design intended to respond to the platform and environment that a user is on. When HTML was created, most people used PCs. Today, people can browse a website on a PC, phone, tablet, or even a game console. In the past, developers created separate sites for “desktop” and “mobile.” While it worked, it wasn't easy to maintain. Rather than creating separate sites, responsive design generates the site based on the environment it detects. This greatly reduces the amount of development and maintenance for the site. Responsive design is generally achieved with a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p><p><strong>What is Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)?</strong></p><p><strong>CSS </strong>or <strong>Cascading Style Sheets </strong>is a style sheet language used to style markup language. Markup languages include HTML, XHML, XML, and other XML-based languages. The most common use of CSS is to style HTML web pages. Although HTML doesn't need CSS to function, every web page would look the same without it. With CSS, you can target specific elements in a web page and change the look and arrangement on the page. CSS can make an embedded image small or cover the entire webpage as a background. You can enlarge a heading and apply a specific font to stand out from the rest of the page. Other things you can do with CSS include changing the color of elements, making elements float to one side of the page, and the list goes on. Every web page uses HTML, and every web page that has its unique look uses CSS.</p><p><strong>What careers use CSS?</strong></p><p><strong>CSS </strong>applies to any career that involves web development. Web designers create the templates, mockups, and styles for a website using HTML and CSS that web developers use to build websites. Front-end web developers use CSS with HTML and JavaScript to build front-end web applications that run in the browser. Fullstack web developers create both the part of a web application that runs in the browser and on the server and need to know CSS to make the front-end look good. Content managers may need to know CSS to apply custom styles to articles they publish through a content management system like WordPress. Other job titles that may require you to know CSS include junior web developer, social media manager, website editor, content editor, website project manager, website support specialist, and webmaster.</p><p><strong>What skills should I have before learning CSS?</strong></p><p>Before learning <strong>CSS</strong>, you should know the basics of using a computer and how to use a text editor because that is where you will be writing CSS. You should also be familiar with web browsers for browsing the web because it will inform your use of CSS. Since you may end up using specialized tools to write CSS, you should know how to install software on your computer and create and manage files and folders on your computer so you can create a CSS project. Once you have those skills down, the next thing to learn is HTML; after all, CSS is nothing without an HTML page to apply styles. That should be the basics you need to know to get started with CSS.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Fresh Content</em></strong></p><p>It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate.

Finally, in the last section, you'll learn how to </p><ul><li>Deploy the application</li><li>Deploy the database </li><li>Create custom build configurations (development, testing, staging, etc)</li><li>Store application settings in web.config and override them for different environments</li><li>Secure application settings and connection strings</li><li>And more...</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Whether you're new to ASP.NET MVC or have some experience but are looking for a course to fill in the gaps, you'll love this course. On top of all the core features of ASP.NET MVC, <strong>Mosh teaches you a systematic way to build a feature end-to-end. </strong>And more importantly, he includes you as part of building a sophisticated feature end-to-end. So, he builds some parts and delegates the other parts to you. </p><p><br></p><p>If you've taken any of Mosh's courses before, you know what you get. He is very passionate, clear and concise in his teaching. Every section and every lecture has been perfectly thought through to lead you on a <strong>step-by-step journey from zero to hero with no fluff whatsoever</strong>. If you're looking for 10+ hours of wasted time on the content you don't need and a rambling instructor, there are other courses you can enrol in.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>PREREQUISITES</strong></p><p>In order to take this course, you should have at least 3 months experience programming in C#. Also, any familiarity with Entity Framework will be helpful but not required. <br></p><p>If you need to strengthen your C# skills or learn Entity Framework in depth, you can watch Mosh's related courses:</p><ul><li>C# Basics for Beginners (essential knowledge)</li><li>C# Intermediate: Classes, interfaces and Object-oriented (essential knowledge)</li><li>C# Advanced (essential knowledge)</li><li>Entity Framework in Depth (nice to have)</li></ul><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>So, if you watch all the lectures and do all the exercises, by the end of this course, you'll have the necessary skills to build real-world applications with ASP.NET MVC 5, or all your money back (within 30 days of taking the course).</strong><br></p><p><br>So, if you're looking for an ASP.NET MVC course with <br></p><ul><li><strong>A passionate coder and instructor who knows his craft</strong></li><li><strong>Perfect structure </strong></li><li><strong>Balanced mix of theory and practice</strong></li><li><strong>Clear, concise and bite-sized videos </strong></li><li><strong>Lots of real-world examples and coding exercises</strong></li><li><strong>Discussion of best practices </strong></li><li><strong>World-class audio / video production</strong></li></ul><p><br></p><p>Don't look further. Enroll in the course now and<strong> learn to build and deploy fast and secure web applications with ASP.NET MVC 5.</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>1- Does this course cover ASP.NET Core 1.0? </strong></p><p>No! Once you master ASP.NET MVC 5, you can quickly get up to speed with ASP.NET Core. Mosh has a follow up course on Udemy called Build a Real-world App with ASP.NET Core and Angular. In this course, you'll get up to speed with ASP.NET Core in the context of building a real app from A to Z. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>2- Why should I pay for this course when there are lots of free tutorials available?</strong></p><p>Free tutorials and YouTube videos are free for a reason. They introduce you to a few concepts here and there, but soon you'll find yourself jumping from one tutorial to another to fill the missing gaps. By taking a perfectly-structured course, you'll be confident that you're in good hands, right from the beginning all the way through to the very end. You pay for saving your precious time: the time that you can spend on the things you love. </p><p>Plus, many of these free tutorials, including tutorials published by Microsoft on the official ASP.NET website, teach you poor practices. Throughout this course, Mosh points out some of these poor practices and explains in technical terms why you should avoid them. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>WHAT OTHER STUDENTS WHO HAVE TAKEN THIS COURSE SAY</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The is course is very much worth your time and money. Mosh did an outstanding job explaining each aspect of MVC 5 as well as introducing and using other technologies such as Web API. I've been working with MVC since it's release but felt I needed a refresher course and this was excellent. I would also recommend it to developers just getting into MVC as well because Mosh does a great job of explaining the concepts behind what you're learning. I really enjoyed it and highly recommend it. -Scott Smith<br></p><p><br></p><p>Course teaches exactly what the title promises to teach. Quality of production, content, and lectures are excellent! Explanations of the how and why are also a nice touch! -Pierre Gadea</p><p><br></p><p>Mosh never disappoints. Clear explanations. Exercises that will test you knowledge. Great instruction as always. I also love that he includes shortcuts and best practices. Worth the time and money! -Lara Caves</p><p><br></p><p>Amazing course from Mosh! After I finished the C# series, I moved directly to this course and learn so much and even developed a successful web app in my internship! Thanks Mosh for a great course!! -Menny Atia</p><p><br></p><p>I've been into web development for more than 15 years, but until recently I was totally new to ASP.NET MVC. Before taking this course I tried other courses, but these were either too complicated for a beginner or didn't cover all the necessery informations needed to get started. This is an excellent course to begin with ASP.NET MVC that covers everything you need to create a real world project. The prerequisites are a good understaning of C# (OOP, Lambdas, LINQ...) , Javascript and JQuery -Marko Pavic</p><p><br></p><p>Professionally structured, carefully planned course. Passionate, engaging instructor with great communication skills. Best course I've ever had on Udemy so far. I would love to take the follow-up course on architecture and testing mentioned in the final video. -Istvan Voros</p><p><br></p><p>One of the best courses i have ever taken,Recommend for every C# developer through his all the courses in Udemy. They are eye-openers and it will change the way you think about Programming.After taking his courses ,with in a span of one month i have a cracked a interview in one of the Big 4 with 70% hike. -Rama Reddy</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>30-DAY FULL MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE</strong></p><p>This course comes with a 30-day full money-back guarantee.

It can be as simple as making a static text-based website or as elaborate as developing an interactive dynamic website. You can break web development into two different categories: frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side). Frontend code executes on the user's computer. This can include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Backend code runs on the server — this commonly includes communicating with a database and often involves languages like Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP. Web development does not necessarily include the design process — it focuses on code. A web designer builds wireframes to mockup their vision for a website and then shares that with a developer. The developer is responsible for writing the code that implements the design.</p><p><strong>What are the steps to becoming a web developer?</strong></p><p>Some web developers will obtain a degree or certification in the field. However, most jobs don't require a specific degree or level of education, just demonstrated knowledge of the field. So, it is more important that you know how to show off your skills. You could highlight your skills through relevant work experience or a portfolio of past projects. You might also share code you have developed using a platform like GitHub, or participate in solution-based forums like StackOverflow that reward you for helping others. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the first three coding languages you'll need to learn to break into web development. You need these three essential elements to create a modern website and work as a frontend web developer. HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) specifies the content of the website and builds the backbone. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles the content. JavaScript controls the interactive elements of the website.</p><p><strong>How long does it take to become a web developer?</strong></p><p>The answer to this question will depend on you. The more time you spend developing your skills, the faster you can become a web developer. The good news is that web development generally uses light-weight code that is easier to learn than many other languages. If dedicated, you can learn the basics of web development in a couple of months. But good web developers never stop learning. A better question might be, What can I do to become a better web developer faster? The answer to this question is practice. Becoming familiar with coding helps tremendously, but there is also a less obvious benefit of practicing. The more you code, the more you will run into problems or find bugs in your code. A significant aspect of web development is solving problems and debugging code. The better you get at solving problems and tracking down bugs, the faster you will get at coding.</p><p><strong>What is React?</strong></p><p>React is a front-end library in Javascript that was developed by Facebook. The simplest definition of React is that it is a user interface library used for building UI components for the web. But if that was all React did, it would be little more than a template library. Developers define components in React by using an HTML-like syntax called JSX. These encapsulated components manage their own state, making it simple to pass rich data to a component and keep the state of the application and its components out of the Document Object Model (DOM). These features give React components the ability to react dynamically and efficiently to changes in their state. A set of simple components in React can be composed into either simple single-page applications or large, complex web applications.</p><p><strong>What is React used for?</strong></p><p>React is an open-source JavaScript frontend library. Some developers consider it a frontend framework because it does more than standard libraries usually do. The most common use of React is to build dynamic user interfaces for single-page web applications. But the structure of React makes it useful for more than just creating websites. JSX, which is one feature of React, is a syntax extension for Javascript that provides a template for the HTML and manages the state of the element. But JSX can be used as an interface for things other than HTML. React Native uses React to build mobile applications. Here, JSX becomes an interface for mobile UIs instead of HTML. There are even a few libraries that use React and JSX to interact with and manage hardware like React Hardware.</p><p><strong>How does React work?</strong></p><p>React encourages engineers to write code using a Functional Programming approach. Engineers create components, which are normal Javascript functions. These functions return information to tell React what content should be displayed on the screen. The real power of React comes from the ability to nest or compose these functions inside of one another. This nesting ability encourages code reuse and allows an engineer to write a component a single time, but in many different places.</p><p><strong>Is React a framework or library?</strong></p><p>Frameworks provide an opinionated approach to building an entire application. Libraries, on the other hand, assist in building a single aspect of an application. With this in mind, React is a library. It assists engineers in presenting HTML in the browser. React has no opinions on how data is fetched, how styling is applied, or how the app is deployed or built.</p><p><strong>Is React worth learning?</strong></p><p>Yes, React is worth learning. There are a couple of reasons. The first one is that React is in high demand in the software development job market and has been for a few years. If you learn to code in React and can do it well, you will increase your chances of finding a job. This alone is another reason it is worth learning. Website users no longer will settle for old-fashioned sites that won't update without a page reload. React’s method of dynamically updating the HTML of a web page fits these users' needs and improves their experience. React has also been around a few years and has stood the test of time. A large portion of websites, both small and large, use React as a frontend framework.</p><p><strong>Is React hard to learn?</strong></p><p>Every technology or programming language has a learning curve, and React is no different. But it is easy to learn if you are dedicated and determined to create frontend web applications. To make learning React simpler, you should stick to the basics of React before you add any extra libraries, as that will only complicate your learning experience in the beginning. Since React is a Javascript framework, a solid grounding in Javascript will give you a head start. With this knowledge, the unique concept of JSX, React's templating language, and the way React uses state will be much easier to grasp.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and ReactJS, and which one should I learn?</strong></p><p>React, or React JS, is a front-end Javascript library for building UI components for the web. If you are interested in web development, React is the perfect library to learn to create interactive, dynamic single-page apps, or even full-scale web applications. React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications for both the Android phone and Apple's iPhone. React Native is still React, which means the syntax and workflow for building applications are basically the same, but the generated components are different. In React, web components are generated. In React Native, the generated components interact with a phone's native APIs. If your focus is web development, then you should learn React. If you want to build mobile applications, it is best to learn React first and become familiar with the technology before you try React Native.</p><p><strong>Why is React so popular?</strong></p><p>There are many reasons why React is popular. One reason is that Facebook developed it. The social proof is that if it is good enough for Facebook, one of the most popular social networks on the web, it should be good enough for other applications. React also solved many of the past issues that developers had with developing single-page applications (SPAs). React came out when SPAs were becoming popular, and all the existing frameworks to build them made development complicated and prone to bugs. One feature that makes it better than past libraries is that React is relatively easy to use. Its components are reusable, plus React's use of the virtual DOM makes it very performant. React should remain popular in the future as each new release brings new features and performance improvements.</p><p><strong>What is Node.Js and what is it used for?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is a server environment built for fast and easily scalable network applications. It was built on Chrome’s JavaScript runtime and uses an event-driven, non-blocking model that makes it the best fit for applications that run on distributed devices and need to run in real-time. By using JavaScript, node.Js can be put to work by many software developers familiar with JavaScript. Because the code is open-source, you can also use it on any platform (Mac OS, Windows, or Linux). Node.js is the architecture for creating websites and real-time applications because it’s easy for teams to learn, and it’s fast. Examples of applications that use node.Js include video conferencing apps, chat servers, eCommerce software, and collaborative online gaming.</p><p><strong>What are the advantages of Node.Js?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is open-source, meaning it’s free code for all developers. On top of that, it also means that there is a thriving community of Node.Js users and programmers that all add to the knowledge base. Many are happy to share their flavor of the code with other developers, and collectively, the Node.Js environment continues to be enhanced. Because Node.Js uses JavaScript, there is a large pool of developers that understand and can code in the environment. It’s also a relatively simple environment for new team members to learn, making it an efficient choice for development teams with people that need training. Node.Js was developed on Push technology instead of web sockets, which is why it’s the preferred choice for real-time communication applications and programs that need to be highly scalable.</p><p><strong>What does it mean that Node.Js is a runtime system?</strong></p><p>A runtime system is a platform where a software program runs. It’s essentially an environment housing the collection of software and hardware that allows an application to execute (or run). Node.Js is a runtime system because it provides the environment necessary for applications to run within it, and no additional code or hardware is required. Because Node.Js makes use of JavaScript, it’s a runtime system that provides a framework where you can use JavaScript to create and run programs. The JavaScript programming language (which is quite popular) is then automatically translated into machine code for the hardware to run the program in real-time. It’s an efficient system, making it the preferred choice for many software and tech companies.</p><p><strong><em>Fresh Content</em></strong></p><p>It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate.

With it, you can drag and drop your way to a powerful website design. Elementor works a little differently from most page builders. For a start, you design live on the front-end of your site, not in the back-end Dashboard.</p><p>The free version is a page builder that comes with dozens of beautiful widgets and templates that you can use to build your web page content with pixel-perfect precision. It's an impressive and well-established page-builder.</p><p>The free version of Elementor will blow you away! If you have ever been frustrated trying to make your WordPress theme look like the demo you saw on the theme's homepage, you are not alone. Most themes require extra plugins and in-depth knowledge of the support documentation to make it look anything like the one that drew you to it in the first place. With Elementor Pro, you don't need to ever feel that frustration again. Elementor Pro gives you the same drag and drop page builder, but also allows you to create your own WordPress theme, designed exactly as you want it.</p><p>This Elementor course covers the free version of Elementor.</p><p>After a discussion of why you should learn Elementor, you'll install the plugin and a theme. We'll then cover:</p><ul><li><p>How to borrow inspiration from other websites, to craft your own unique design. That includes choosing the right fonts and colors for your site.</p></li><li><p>We'll take a look at Hex color codes.</p></li><li><p>You'll become familiar with the front-end Elementor interface as we go through all of the menu and settings.</p></li><li><p>You'll get to know how an Elementor page is structured using sections, columns, and elements. At this stage, I'll set you a few design tasks and then go over the solutions in detail.</p></li><li><p>You'll learn how to use templates so that you can create a design element once, and re-use it as many times as you want. You can even export your templates from one site and import them into another.</p></li><li><p>You'll see why global widgets are a powerful asset in your toolbox.</p></li><li><p>Elementor offers you some great tools, including motion effects. These can be used to bring movement to your pages, so we'll look at those.</p></li><li><p>And finally, we'll look at mobile optimization. This powerful set of tools will allow you to check (and fix) your site design so that it looks great on a desktop, tablet, and mobile phone.</p><p><br></p><p>Elementor was created for every site owner that wants to create beautiful web content. It was created to allow you to design the site YOU want. This course teaches you how to use it!</p></li></ul>|plugins, wordpress, menu, desktop, widgets, toolbox, web, website, homepage, websites

I was a complete beginner but </em><strong><em>Angela made me a pro</em></strong><em> in weeks.</em> - Burak Tunçbilek</p><p><em>IT IS #1!!!!!!!!! Absolutely Amazing. The best iOS course i have ever taken. Angela explains everything the way it needs to be explained, so everything is easily understood. The concept of </em><strong><em>this course is built to make you learn, not just watch</em></strong><em> and repeat. Angela is highly educated and it is very much noticeable during the entire course.

Take a look at what students on my course had to say about this:</strong></p><p><em>I have revamped my expectation for what a</em><strong><em> 5 star course </em></strong><em>should be for Udemy. Angela, you're awesome! I already rated the course as 5 stars early on (at about 20% completion), but after completing roughly 70% of the course, I can say this is my favourite Udemy course as of today. Brilliant course Angela!</em> - Alberto L</p><p><em>I took a lot of courses on Udemy and elsewhere and non of them were as clear and perfectly paced as this one! Angelas approach is really awesome, </em><strong><em>deep and clear</em></strong><em>. - Žan Fras</em></p><p><em>I have taken several iOS courses, so far this course had the </em><strong><em>best explanation </em></strong><em>on swift and xcode documentation.

The instructor solved my queries in a day or two. I am waiting for the next course from the instructor. Top-notch quality. </em></strong>-Ankur Sharma</p><p>If you’re a developer struggling with GraphQL because of its complexity… or simply because it takes too much time, this is going to be the most exciting news for you.</p><p>Listen, If I told you… that you can take your existing Relational Database and turn it into a powerful GraphQL API in a matter of seconds…</p><p>Or... build a performant GraphQL backend from start to finish in a couple of hours with very little to no coding...</p><p>Would you be interested?</p><p>My name is Dmytro Mezhenskyi.</p><p>And even with 9 years of experience as a web developer and teacher, I couldn’t get over the amount of time it takes to complete my GraphQL APIs.</p><p>I found that most of my time was wasted on mundane repetitive tasks. Tasks like writing the CRUD code over and over again… for every single entity in the database.</p><p>And it doesn’t matter if you’re a beginner or expert in GraphQL… it still takes up way too much time.</p><p><strong>In that time, you could’ve already had your project up and running. And you could’ve done it without the stress from the deadline creeping in and your boss breathing down your neck.</strong></p><p>Two years ago, I started searching for solutions to make GraphQL development more automated and I came across Hasura. It had a lot of issues back then but it still felt like a revelation for me.</p><p>And you'll feel the same way about it too in just a minute.</p><p>Because… when you learn how to use Hasura, you'll be able to create your GraphQL backends easier and faster than you ever thought possible<strong> without writing a single line of code! </strong></p><p>And you don't have to take my word for it...</p><p><strong>Here’s what other developers are saying about Hasura:</strong></p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>“<em>Wow. @HasuraHQ is seriously impressive. I just set up an entire backend (database, GraphQL API, authentication, authorization) in less than an hour without ever touching a terminal!</em>” - Cole Bemis</p><p>“<em>Check out @HasuraHQ, this is crazy s*#&amp;!. I can write a whole application powered by GraphQL without writing a line of backend code!</em>” - Thomas Heyenbrock</p><p>“<em>I just tried @HasuraHQ for the first time and my mind is genuinely blown. I built a fully deployed GraphQL setup that would have taken me hours normally in like 30 seconds. It's incredible how fast the developer ecosystem evolves.</em>” - Ali Spittel</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><strong>And the crazy thing is… MOST developers don’t even know about it! </strong></p><p>When I started creating my GraphQL APIs using Hasura, it took me a couple of months to get the hang of it and even more time to master it because I didn’t have anyone to teach me the nuts and bolts back then.</p><p>But even with all that effort, it was absolutely worth it!</p><p>In fact, in all my years of web development, no other tool has been more useful.</p><p>And that’s why I created this course, <strong>the most comprehensive course on Hasura </strong>with: 9 segments, 80 lectures and 6.5+ hours packed with <strong>engaging</strong> content that'll allow you to master Hasura in the shortest time possible.</p><p>It covers all the basics, and the more advanced features, and dives into all the little details that I wish I knew when I started using Hasura.</p><p>When you’re done with this course, <strong>you’ll be able to use every functionality to create your GraphQL backends effortlessly in record time.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Here’s what other students are saying about this course:</strong></p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><em>Wow, the best course on Hasura you will ever find!</em> - Shimon Wosner</p><p><br></p><p><em>“I'm halfway through the course and absolutely enjoying it! This is the easiest starting with GraphQL ever. Thank you and keep it up!”</em> - Daria Lazurenko</p><p><br></p><p><em>“Exactly what I was looking for to up-skill for Hasura, assuming we go Hasura for our next project I will be recommending this course for all DevOps, API developers, and UI Developers on the project!”</em> - Joseph D Garrepy</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><strong>In the first few sections of this course, you’ll learn things like:</strong></p><p>…How to let the CRUD code write itself without you even touching your keyboard.</p><p>…How to play with all the different features in Hasura using the “playground” approach.</p><p>…How to easily navigate through the most common errors that can cost you a huge chunk of your time if you don’t know about them.</p><p>…And A LOT more.</p><p><strong>But there are a few things you should keep in mind…</strong></p><p>1. There is no fluff in this course… we’ll be diving right in without wasting any time.</p><p>2. This is not just a “what to do” guide. You’ll be learning about the concepts behind what we are doing. The “why.”</p><p>3. If we need to write any code to extend Hasura’s functionality, I’ll be writing along with you so that it’s easier to follow through. This is NOT a “copy-paste some spaghetti code” type of course. We’ll dissect every little feature Hasura has to offer and how you can use it to your advantage.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Along the way, you’ll discover things like:</strong></p><p>· The best way to secure your Hasura endpoint and the mistakes you must avoid.</p><p>· When you should extend business logic and exactly how to do it</p><p>· The one thing that you CAN NOT miss when you’re doing database migrations (If you don’t want other developers to hate you)</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How do you go through this course?</strong></p><p>1- Go through the different segments, one at a time, taking a 10-minute break in between each segment to let your brain soak in all the information you learned. DO NOT watch it all in one go. It’s tempting but it might overwhelm your brain…</p><p>2- Play along with me. If you just watch without doing anything, you’ll learn a lot… but I designed this course with easy step-by-step instructions so you can get the maximum value by following along with me. Note: Hasura will be really fun when you know your way around it.</p><p>3- If any concept seems a bit confusing, rewind the lecture and watch it again, this time paying attention to the subtle important explanations. If you do this, you’ll start feeling a lot more comfortable with Hasura as a whole.</p><p>4- Refer back to the course if you’re stuck at any point with a project you’re working on. The course is divided into small lectures so you can quickly go through the one you need.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Important to note</strong></p><p>I am constantly updating this course with Hasura’s latest features so that everything you’re learning is up-to-date. I am also further polishing it using your feedback to include deployment, and examples with your favorite front-end frameworks. </p><p>While that sounds great, it also means that the course’s value is always increasing and so the price might go up as well in the near future.</p><p>The only way you can guarantee yourself lifetime access to all the available AND future lessons at the current price is if you enroll in the course right now.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><p>-Dmytro Mezhenskyi</p>|fast, spaghetti, powerful, maximum, latest, extensive, huge, expert, favorite, 2022

I have role to train new Folks for java. I have enrolled in 20+ courses in Java for different authors to check what is the best content available on Udemy but the way u have explained the concepts and provided homework and coding exercises(in test format) is incredibly outstanding. I am 100% sure whoever takes this course, will be able to crack java interviews. Thanks for this hard work which you have put on this course.

After analysis, we understand what will help students to learn Java in a more efficient way. In this course:</p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching other 30 minutes lessons. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Only your homework and coding exercises including the EXAM&nbsp;task might take approximately 20 hours to implement.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 18 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. </p><p><strong>- Sequence of lessons</strong></p><p>After the years of teaching offline, and based on the feedback of students who are passing online courses we realized how important the sequence of lessons is while teaching Java. The same issue is with the books where information is completely unstructured what makes things even more complex. For example, how students can learn object-oriented programming from the first lesson if they don't know yet the java syntax basics?&nbsp;Or how a student can implement a home task if he/she doesn't aware of java methods specifics, or doesn't know yet how to read program input?</p><p>So in this course, you can be sure, that you will not get a home task to implement without having enough information to implement it. The program which is in this course is proven by many students who completed it offline and now work as software engineers in outsourcing companies and as freelancers.</p><p><strong>- Interview practice tests<br><br></strong>Being an IT consultant in different companies, the tutor of this course was in charge of driving the interview process in companies to make sure, that company selects the best people. That's why the first interview is always test. In case the test is completed, the candidate is invited to have a conversation. That's why in this course we want to prepare you to complete tests successfully! </p><p>Especially for our students, we prepared tests that could be used to evaluate their knowledge during the interview process. </p><p>2 tests. 90 questions each <strong>(180 interview tests in total). </strong>120 minutes each.</p><p>You can read explanations for answers! That also can help you to learn the material better. Don't wait, try it now!</p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support</strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning processes is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concepts or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong></p><p><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.</p><p><strong>- Coding exercises </strong></p><p>To learn to program is not enough just watching videos and reading books. You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will have different practical tasks which will help you learn and understand Java better. </p><p>One of the key tasks where you can practice your knowledge is the implementation of a backend system for an online store. Also, you have a lot of tasks that use domain-specific terminology:&nbsp;accounts, transactions, users, carts, menu, services, etc. So that means you are learning programming without abstract concepts like it is written in the books or in other courses. You learn domain-specific terminology and during the lessons, we investigate specific extracts from code that can give you a clear vision of how you can apply the knowledge in real life.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait! Take a look at the lessons' preview if you still have doubts! </p><p><strong><em>Buy this course today, and you will get all updates for FREE! </em></strong></p><p>Right now our team keeps working on the next lessons for this course. We are preparing for you a lot of other topics and coding exercises! Our goal - to create a web application together with you. Buy this course today, and you will receive all updates for free! Isn't that cool?&nbsp;:) </p><p><br></p><p>For those who successfully passed this training course, or for students who were recognized for asking amazing questions, there is a special offer from the IT-Bulls company! The creator of this course is IT-Bulls company CEO&nbsp;and Founder. We are always in search of talents to run our amazing startups together with you. Probably you always dreamed about running your own startup?&nbsp;In this course, you will be able to find the team who will teach you how to do that and (in particular cases) will be glad to help with implementation! </p><p>Hope you enjoy this course!

Once you learn about the basics, you can move forward to more intermediate concepts such as <strong>working and interacting with a basic MySQL database</strong> and performing the absolute necessary queries. </p><p>The moment you can do this, you can build your code logic to present the information to the user. You can<strong> build forms</strong>, <strong>subscription logic</strong>, <strong>login systems</strong>, <strong>fetch records</strong> and <strong>display them in any way you deem fit</strong>, building projects such as <strong>e-shops</strong>, <strong>blogs </strong>and even <strong>your own CMS systems</strong>. Because this is when you truly know how to use and create interactive content. Creating interactive content, it means the <strong>user can perform even more tasks</strong> and thus <strong>stay and interact with your application longer</strong>. Upside to this is that you can further build the <strong>user's experience</strong> (<strong>UX</strong>) by introducing new concepts when otherwise wouldn't be possible on a static web page.</p><p>The rule of thumb states that the websites you create should have ideal design and be articulate for the user, <strong>but even if a website is perfect to these aspects</strong> if you have a <strong>non-properly working backend</strong>, or<strong> poor server architecture</strong>, you'll going to hit the wall really soon and hard. So make sure you know your <strong>PHP back-bone</strong> and make proper <strong>implementations </strong>by always <strong>consulting your documentation</strong> and <strong>design document</strong>.

We will also install the tools you will need to start making Django web apps. We will learn how to install Django and setup a Django project both on Windows &amp; Mac individually.</p><p><strong>Section 2:</strong> <strong>Views &amp; URL Patterns</strong></p><p>Django is based on the MVT(Model, Views &amp; Templates) architecture and hence we start learning about what are views, how to create our very first view in Django which will power up our first webpage in Django. We then learn how to attach a view with a URL using URL patterns. We learn what are URL patterns and how they can be used to handle incoming URL requests to our Django app. This view section covers function based views as they are much simpler and offer more functionality, however in the later part of the course we will also learn class based views as well which is another way of implementing views in&nbsp;Django.</p><p><strong>Section 3:</strong> <strong>Database &amp; Models In Django</strong></p><p>After learning about Views and URLs, it's now time to learn about models. In Django models are a blueprint to create database tables. Unlike other backend frameworks, in Django you don't have to create a database connection and then create database tables by writing SQL queries but instead Django provides you with models using which database tables are automatically generated at the backend without having to write a single SQL query. In this section we learn how to create a model and how to map that model to create a database table out of it in the backend.</p><p><strong>Section 4: Django ORM</strong></p><p>Just as you don't have to write SQL queries to create a model, you don't have to write any queries for querying data from the database either. Django comes with a built-in ORM which stands for Object Relational Mapper which allows you to treat database table entries as individual objects. In this section we learn how to add data to database tables using the ORM and also learn how to retrieve data as well from the database using the same. We also learn how to access the Django admin panel by creating a super user from where data could be added by the site administrator. </p><p><strong>Section 5: Views &amp; Templates</strong></p><p>Once we have learned the basics of how views work in Django, we now learn how to populate these views with some database data. We also learn how to connect these views with templates which are nothing but HTML pages rendered dynamically by Django. We also learn how dynamic database data can be injected into these templates by passing context. We also learn how to create detailed views for products and handling hardcoded URLs associated with these detail views.</p><p><strong>Section 6: Adding Styling To Django Project With CSS &amp; Tailwind</strong></p><p>After making a barebones app, we now learn how to style up our Django app. There are multiple CSS frameworks and libraries that can be used for styling apps but the one we will be using is Tailwind CSS. It is one of the most modern ways of styling the webpage. With its utility classes we can style every element of our webpage inline without having to create an external CSS file for it. We will learn how to setup Tailwind for a Django project, how to create a navigation bar with it and also how to stye out Django powered webpages with Tailwind.</p><p><strong>Section 7: Form &amp; CRUD&nbsp;Operations In&nbsp;Django</strong></p><p>Every web application has to perform basic operations like create, read, update &amp; delete data which is also termed as CRUD. In this section we will learn how to design forms in Django so that the end user of our website could perform all these four operations without any issues. Once you learn how to implement CRUD in Django you will be capable of building almost any basic web application in Django.</p><p><strong>Section 8: Authentication</strong></p><p>It important that we limit certain features of our website to registered users and this is exactly what we will be learning in this section. We learn how to register a user to our Django app, how to login a user and how to control access to certain pages and certain actions to just these logged in users. We also learn how to design the logout functionality so that the users could log out of our application. This entire process is called authentication and we will learn how to implement authentication in our Django app.</p><p><strong>Section 9: Creating User Profile</strong></p><p>Every registered user must have their own profile, in this section we will start off by learning how to add a functionality that allows every user to create their own profile. We will then learn how to associate a user with the products which they have posted for selling on our Django web app. This can be done by using relationships and keys between two models. We will connect the user model with the product model so that every product would be associated with a user. We will also create a listing page for every user where they can view all the products listed by them on our web app.</p><p><strong>Section 10: Class Based Views In Django</strong></p><p>We have already learned about the function based view in the earlier part of the course but there is an alternative and a cleaner approach of creating views and that is using class based views. In this section we will re-create every single function based view which is present in our application into a class based view and in the process also learn about the generic views offered by Django such as the ListView, DetailView, CreateView, UpdateView &amp; the DeleteView. we also learn how to add a redirect URL to these views as well.</p><p><strong>Section 11: Customising Admin Panel</strong></p><p>Every Django application we create comes with a built in Admin panel &amp; it provides us with a functionality to customise this admin panel as per our own needs. In this section we will learn how we could modify the admin headers, how to add custom fields to our model in the admin panel, how to add custom search fields and custom actions as well and how to make fields of a model editable inside the admin panel. </p><p><strong>Section 12: Pagination &amp; Search</strong></p><p>Displaying hundreds of products on a single page can be challenging, loading them all on a single page might increase the page load times and here is where pagination comes into picture. Pagination is a process of spreading out items in your database to multiple web pages instead of listing them all on a single page. This ensures a better user experience and quick page load times. In this section we will learn how to implement pagination functionality in our Django application and also implement a search functionality which allows users to search multiple products on our web application.</p><p><strong>Section 13: Payment Gateway Integration With Stripe</strong></p><p>Accepting payments is an integral part of any commercial website, hence in this section we will learn how to integrate stripe payment gateway into our Django app so that end users could pay for products and buy them. We will learn how to create a stipe account, how to add secret keys to our application ,we learn how to design the payment and checkout flow to buy any product on our site and return a payment success view upon successful payment. This payment flow could be integrated into any other Django application which you could create.</p><p><strong>Section 14: Deployment</strong></p><p>This is one of the most interesting part of the course because we will finally be able to deploy our website to the public internet where anyone in the world could access it. We will be using Git &amp; GitHub to initially host our entire project&nbsp; code online and then deploy the same code form GitHub to DigitalOcean app platform. We learn how to create a code pipeline in such a way that code could be deployed from your local code editor, to Git, to GitHub and finally to DigitalOcean app platform. We learn how to set the environment variables to keep our secret app key private and also learn how to host a remote database and then connect it to our deployed Django application. We will also learn how to fix any issues which may arise in the due process.</p><p><br></p><p>So let's begin the journey of becoming a<strong> Django expert.</strong></p><p>In addition to the <strong>Udemy</strong> <strong>30-day money back guarantee</strong>, you have my personal guarantee that you will love what you learn in this course.

1673770|NgRx (with NgRx Data) - The Complete Guide (Angular 14)|899|/course/ngrx-course/|backend|0|4.5|en|Angular University|<p>This course is a <strong>complete guide to the new NgRx Ecosystem</strong>, including NgRx Data, Store, Effects, Router Store, NgRx Entity, and DevTools, and comes with a running Github repo</p><p><strong>This Course in a Nutshell</strong></p><p>State management is the number one topic to know when it comes to <strong>frontend architecture</strong> design choices. Why choose to do state management in a single page application, when to do it and why, what are the benefits, and what are tradeoffs?</p><p>These are all critical questions that we will address in this course, as we give you an extended guided tour of the NgRx Ecosystem.</p><p>The <strong>most popular state management library</strong> in the Angular space is NgRx, and for good reasons. The latest release of NgRx is <em>probably one of the most important releases</em> in the whole Angular ecosystem recently. Although backward compatible, it contains so much new functionality that it's almost a brand new state management library.</p><p>Under the hood, the <strong>core concepts</strong> of Actions, Reducers, Effects, Entities, and Selectors remain the same, but we have now a <em>brand new API</em> for managing these concepts in a much less verbose way. Also, we have the inclusion of <strong>NgRx Data</strong>, which is a new and very powerful way of managing Entity Data.</p><p>Actually, NgRx Data is a <em>powerful abstraction layer</em> on top of NgRx, that allows us to add state management to large parts of our application without having to write much code at all!</p><p><strong>Course Overview</strong></p><p>In this course, we are going to take a small existing application that is built <strong>without any state management</strong>. We are going to understand what are the consequences of not doing state management by identifying some problems that the application has in its initial form.</p><p>Then we are going to start refactoring the application, and we are going to add state management to the application multiple screens step-by-step. We are going to start with the <strong>Authentication features</strong> of the application, and then we are going to move on to the <strong>entity data management</strong> part.</p><p>We are going to explain at length all the <strong>key concepts of NgRx</strong>: Actions, Reducers, Effects, and Selectors, and we are going to explain in detail the Store architecture itself and understand its benefits.</p><p>Throughout the course we are going to introduce step-by-step and explain in detail the <strong>NgRx Store module, NgRx Effects</strong>, we are going to cover in detail <strong>NgRx Entity</strong> and the Entity format, we are going to install and do a guided tour of the <strong>NgRx Dev Tools, the NgRx Router Store,</strong> and the time-travelling debugger.</p><p>We are also going to learn how to make the most out of <strong>NgRx Data</strong>, and learn how to customize it in order to manage entity data with minimal application code. We will cover NgRx while keeping in mind <strong>best practices</strong> like good Action hygiene.</p><p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p><p>This course covers the following topics:</p><ul><li><p>Introduction to State Management</p></li><li><p>The Store Architecture In Detail</p></li><li><p>NgRx Key Concepts</p></li><li><p>Actions and Action Creators</p></li><li><p>Reducers</p></li><li><p>NgRx Effects</p></li><li><p>Selectors</p></li><li><p>Adding Authentication to an NgRx Application</p></li><li><p>NgRx Entity and the Entity Format</p></li><li><p>NgRx DevTools</p></li><li><p>NgRx Time Travelling Debugger</p></li><li><p>NgRx Runtime checks and Store Immutability</p></li><li><p>NgRx Router Store</p></li><li><p>NgRx Data and Entity State Management</p></li><li><p>NgRx Best Practices</p></li></ul><p><strong>What Will You Learn In this Course?</strong></p><p>At the end of this course, you will feel comfortable with the notions of state management and the centralized store solution in general.</p><p>You will <strong>feel comfortable designing new Applications using NgRx</strong>, using a simple methodology and you will know in-depth the complete Ngrx library ecosystem: including the Ngrx Store, Effects, Entity, and NgRx Data libraries.</p><p>You will know how to quickly scaffold parts of the solution using Ngrx Schematics, and how to set up the Ngrx DevTools from scratch, including the router integration.</p>|creators, powerful, latest, brand, complete, install, designing, library, github, built

1754098|The Data Science Course 2022: Complete Data Science Bootcamp|1099|/course/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp/|datascience|0|4.6|en|365 Careers|<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p><p>Data scientist is one of the best suited professions to thrive this century. It is digital, programming-oriented, and analytical. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the demand for data scientists has been surging in the job marketplace.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>However, supply has been very limited. It is difficult to acquire the skills necessary to be hired as a data scientist.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And how can you do that? &nbsp; </p><p>Universities have been slow at creating specialized data science programs. (not to mention that the ones that exist are very expensive and time consuming)&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Most online courses focus on a specific topic and it is difficult to understand how the skill they teach fit in the complete picture &nbsp; </p><p><strong>The Solution</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Data science is a multidisciplinary field. It encompasses a wide range of topics.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><ul><li><p>Understanding of the data science field and the type of analysis carried out &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Mathematics &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Statistics&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Python&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Applying advanced statistical techniques in Python&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Data Visualization &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Machine Learning &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Deep Learning &nbsp; </p></li></ul><p>Each of these topics builds on the previous ones. And you risk getting lost along the way if you don’t acquire these skills in the right order. For example, one would struggle in the application of Machine Learning techniques before understanding the underlying Mathematics. Or, it can be overwhelming to study regression analysis in Python before knowing what a regression is.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>So, in an effort to create the most effective, time-efficient, and structured data science training available online, we created The Data Science Course 2022.</em></strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>We believe this is the first training program that solves the biggest challenge to entering the data science field <strong>– having all the necessary resources in one place.</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>Moreover, our focus is to teach topics that flow smoothly and complement each other. The course teaches you everything you need to know to become a data scientist at a fraction of the cost of traditional programs (not to mention the amount of time you will save).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Skills</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;1.&nbsp;Intro to Data and Data Science</strong></p><p>Big data, business intelligence, business analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. We know these buzzwords belong to the field of data science but what do they all mean?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>As a candidate data scientist, you must understand the ins and outs of each of these areas and recognise the appropriate approach to solving a problem. This ‘Intro to data and data science’ will give you a comprehensive look at all these buzzwords and where they fit in the realm of data science.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>2. Mathematics</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Learning the tools is the first step to doing data science. You must first see the big picture to then examine the parts in detail.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>We take a detailed look specifically at calculus and linear algebra as they are the subfields data science relies on.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>Calculus and linear algebra are essential for programming in data science. If you want to understand advanced machine learning algorithms, then you need these skills in your arsenal.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>3. Statistics</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>You need to think like a scientist before you can become a scientist. Statistics trains your mind to frame problems as hypotheses and gives you techniques to test these hypotheses, just like a scientist. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>This course doesn’t just give you the tools you need but teaches you how to use them. Statistics trains you to think like a scientist.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>4. Python</strong></p><p>Python is a relatively new programming language and, unlike R, it is a general-purpose programming language. You can do anything with it! Web applications, computer games and data science are among many of its capabilities. That’s why, in a short space of time, it has managed to disrupt many disciplines. Extremely powerful libraries have been developed to enable data manipulation, transformation, and visualisation. Where Python really shines however, is when it deals with machine and deep learning.</p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to developing, implementing, and deploying machine learning models through powerful frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc, Python is a must have programming language. &nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>5. Tableau</strong></p><p>Data scientists don’t just need to deal with data and solve data driven problems. They also need to convince company executives of the right decisions to make. These executives may not be well versed in data science, so the data scientist must but be able to present and visualise the data’s story in a way they will understand. That’s where Tableau comes in – and we will help you become an expert story teller using the leading visualisation software in business intelligence and data science.</p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>A data scientist relies on business intelligence tools like Tableau to communicate complex results to non-technical decision makers. &nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>6. Advanced Statistics</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Regressions, clustering, and factor analysis are all disciplines that were invented before machine learning. However, now these statistical methods are all performed through machine learning to provide predictions with unparalleled accuracy. This section will look at these techniques in detail. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>Data science is all about predictive modelling and you can become an expert in these methods through this ‘advance statistics’ section. &nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>7. Machine Learning</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The final part of the program and what every section has been leading up to is deep learning. Being able to employ machine and deep learning in their work is what often separates a data <em>scientist </em>from a data <em>analyst. </em>This section covers all common machine learning techniques and deep learning methods with TensorFlow. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Machine learning is everywhere. Companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon have been using machines that can learn on their own for years. Now is the time for <em>you</em> to control the machines. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>***What you get***</strong></p><ul><li><p>A $1250 data science training program&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Active Q&amp;A support &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>All the knowledge to get hired as a data scientist &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>A community of data science learners &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>A certificate of completion&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Access to future updates &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Solve real-life business cases that will get you the job&nbsp; &nbsp; </p></li></ul><p><strong>You will become a data scientist from scratch</strong>&nbsp; We are happy to offer an unconditional 30-day money back in full guarantee.

However, <strong>where and how are you going to learn these skills required for Data Science and Machine Learning? </strong></p><p>Data Science and Machine Learning require in-depth knowledge of various topics. Data Science is not just about knowing certain packages/libraries and learning how to apply them. Data Science and Machine Learning require an indepth understanding of the following skills,</p><ul><li><p>Understanding of the overall landscape of Data Science and Machine Learning</p></li><li><p>Different types of Data Analytics, Data Architecture, Deployment characteristics of Data Science and Machine Learning projects</p></li><li><p>Python Programming skills which is the most popular language for Data Science and Machine Learning </p></li><li><p>Mathematics for Machine Learning including Linear Algebra, Calculus and how it is applied in Machine Learning Algorithms as well as Data Science</p></li><li><p>Statistics and Statistical Analysis for Data Science</p></li><li><p>Data Visualization for Data Science </p></li><li><p>Data processing and manipulation before applying Machine Learning</p></li><li><p>Machine Learning</p></li><li><p>Ridge (L2), Lasso (L1) and Elasticnet Regression/ Regularization for Machine Learning </p></li><li><p>Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction for Machine Learning models</p></li><li><p>Machine Learning Model Selection using Cross Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning</p></li><li><p>Cluster Analysis for unsupervised Machine Learning</p></li><li><p>Deep Learning using most popular tools and technologies of today.</p></li></ul><p>This Data Science and Machine Learning course has been designed considering all of the above aspects, the true Data Science and Machine Learning A-Z Course. In many Data Science and Machine Learning courses, algorithms are taught without teaching Python or such programming language. However, it is very important to understand the construct of the language in order to implement any discipline including Data Science and Machine Learning. </p><p>Also, without understanding the Mathematics and Statistics it's impossible to understand how some of the Data Science and Machine Learning algorithms and techniques work. </p><p>Data Science and Machine Learning is a complex set of topics which are interlinked. However, we firmly believe in what <strong>Einstein once said,</strong></p><p><strong>If you can not explain it simply, you have not understood it enough.</strong></p><p>As an instructor, I always try my level best to live up to this principle. <strong>This is one comprehensive course on Data Science and Machine Learning that teaches you everything required to learn Data Science and Machine Learning using the simplest examples with great depth</strong>.</p><p>As you will see from the preview lectures, some of the most complex topics are explained in a simple language. </p><p><strong>Some of the key skills you will learn,</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Python Programming</strong></p><p>Python has been ranked as the #1 language for Data Science and Machine Learning. It is easy to use and is rich with various libraries and functions required for performing various tasks for Data Science and Machine Learning. Moreover, it is the most preferred and default language of use for many Deep Learning frameworks including Tensorflow and Keras. </p><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>Advance Mathematics for Machine Learning</strong></p><p>Mathematics is the very basis for Data Science in general and Machine Learning in particular. Without understanding the meanings of Vectors, Matrices, their operations as well as understanding Calculus, it is not possible to understand the foundation of the Data Science and Machine Learning. Gradient Descent which forms the very basis of Neural Network and Machine Learning is built upon the basics of Calculus and Derivatives.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>Advance Statistics for Data Science</strong></p><p>It is not enough to know only mean, median, mode etc. The advance techniques of Data Science and Machine Learning such as Feature Selection, Dimensionality Reduction using PCA are all based on advance inferential statistics of Distributions and Statistical Significance. It also helps us understanding the data behavior and then apply an appropriate machine learning technique to get the best result from various techniques of Data Science and Machine Learning.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>Data Visualization</strong></p><p>As they say, picture is worth a thousand words. Data Visualization is one of the key techniques of Data Science and Machine Learning and is used for Exploratory Data Analysis. In that, we visually analyse the data to identify the patterns and trends. We are going to learn how to create various plots and charts as well as how to analyse them for all the practical purposes. Feature Selection plays a key role in Machine Learning and Data Visualisation is key for it.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>Data Processing</strong></p><p>Data Science require extensive data processing. Data Science and Machine Learning practitioners spend more than 2/3rd of the time processing and analysing the data. Data can be noisy and is never in the best shape and form. Data Processing is one of the key disciplines of Data Science and Machine Learning to get the best results. We will be using Pandas which is the most popular library for data processing in Python and various other libraries to read, analyse, process and clean the data. </p><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>Machine Learning</strong></p><p>The heart and soul of Data Science is the predictive ability provided by the algorithms from Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Machine Learning takes the overall discipline of Data Science ahead of others. We will combine everything we would learn from the previous sections and build various machine learning models. The key aspects of the Machine Learning is not just about the algorithms but also understanding various parameters used by Machine Learning algorithms. We will understand all the key parameters and how their values impact the outcome so that you can build the best machine learning models.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction</strong></p><p>In case you wonder, what makes a good data scientists, then this section is the answer. A good Data Science and Machine Learning practitioner does not just use libraries and code few lines. She will analyse every feature of the data objectively and choose the most relevant ones based on statistical analysis. We will learn how to reduce the number of features as well as how we can retain the value in the data when we practice and build various machine learning models after applying the principles of Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction using PCA.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>Deep Learning</strong></p><p>You can not become a good Data Science and Machine Learning practitioner, if you do not know how to build powerful neural network. Deep Learning can be said to be another kind of Machine Learning with great power and flexibility. After Learning Machine Learning, we are going to learn some key fundamentals of Deep Learning and build a solid foundation first. We will then use Keras and Tensorflow which are the most popular Deep Learning frameworks in the world. </p><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>Kaggle Project</strong></p><p>As an aspiring Data Scientists, we always wish to work on Kaggle project for Machine Learning and achieve good results. I have spent huge effort and time in making sure you understand the overall process of performing a real Data Science and Machine Learning project. This is going to be a good Machine Learning challenge for you.</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>Your takeaway from this course,</strong></p><ol><li><p>Complete hands-on experience with huge number of Data Science and Machine Learning projects and exercises</p></li><li><p>Learn the advance techniques used in the Data Science and Machine Learning</p></li><li><p>Certificate of Completion for the most in demand skill of Data Science and Machine Learning </p></li><li><p>All the queries answered in shortest possible time. </p></li><li><p>All future updates based on updates to libraries, packages</p></li><li><p>Continuous enhancements and addition of future Machine Learning course material</p></li><li><p>All the knowledge of Data Science and Machine Learning at fraction of cost</p></li></ol><p>This Data Science and Machine Learning course comes with the <strong>Udemy's 30-Day-Money-Back Guarantee with no questions asked.</strong> </p><p><strong>So what you are waiting for?

You will learn step by step with hands-on examples.<br><br><strong>What is data science?<br></strong>We have more data than ever before. But data alone cannot tell us much about the world around us. We need to interpret the information and discover hidden patterns. This is where <strong>data science </strong>comes in. <strong>Data science python </strong>uses algorithms to understand raw data. The main difference between data science and traditional data analysis is its focus on prediction. <strong>Python data science</strong> seeks to find patterns in data and use those patterns to predict future data. It draws on machine learning to process large amounts of data, discover patterns, and predict trends. <strong>Data science using python</strong> includes preparing, analyzing, and processing data. It draws from many scientific fields, and as a<strong> python for data science</strong>, it progresses by creating new algorithms to analyze data and validate current methods.</p><p><strong>What does a data scientist do?<br></strong>Data Scientists use machine learning to discover hidden patterns in large amounts of raw data to shed light on real problems. This requires several steps. First, they must identify a suitable problem. Next, they determine what data are needed to solve such a situation and figure out how to get the data. Once they obtain the data, they need to clean the data. The data may not be formatted correctly, it might have additional unnecessary data, it might be missing entries, or some data might be incorrect. Data Scientists must, therefore, make sure the data is clean before they analyze the data. To analyze the data, they use machine learning techniques to build models. Once they create a model, they test, refine, and finally put it into production.</p><p><strong>What are the most popular coding languagws for data science?<br>Python for data science </strong>is the most popular programming language for data science. It is a universal language that has a lot of libraries available. It is also a good beginner language. R is also popular; however, it is more complex and designed for statistical analysis. It might be a good choice if you want to specialize in statistical analysis. You will want to know either Python or R and SQL. SQL is a query language designed for relational databases. Data scientists deal with large amounts of data, and they store a lot of that data in relational databases. Those are the three most-used programming languages. Other languages such as Java, C++, JavaScript, and Scala are also used, albeit less so. If you already have a background in those languages, you can explore the tools available in those languages. However, if you already know another programming language, you will likely be able to pick up.</p><p><strong>How long does it take to become a data scientist?<br></strong>This answer, of course, varies. The more time you devote to learning new skills, the faster you will learn. It will also depend on your starting place. If you already have a strong base in mathematics and statistics, you will have less to learn. If you have no background in statistics or advanced mathematics, you can still become a data scientist; it will just take a bit longer. Data science requires lifelong learning, so you will never really finish learning. A better question might be, How can I gauge whether I know enough to become a data scientist? Challenge yourself to complete <strong>data science projects</strong> using open data. The more you practice, the more you will learn, and the more confident you will become. Once you have several projects that you can point to as good examples of your skillset as a data scientist, you are ready to enter the field.</p><p><strong>How can ı learn data science on my own?</strong></p><p>It is possible to learn <strong>data science projects</strong> on your own, as long as you stay focused and motivated. Luckily, there are a lot of online courses and boot camps available. Start by determining what interests you about data science. If you gravitate to visualizations, begin learning about them. Starting with something that excites you will motivate you to take that first step. If you are not sure where you want to start, try starting with learning Python. It is an excellent introduction to programming languages and will be useful as a data scientist. Begin by working through tutorials or Udemy courses on the topic of your choice. Once you have developed a base in the skills that interest you, it can help to talk with someone in the field. Find out what skills employers are looking for and continue to learn those skills. When learning on your own, setting practical learning goals can keep you motivated.</p><p><strong>Does data science require coding?<br></strong>The jury is still out on this one. Some people believe that it is possible to become a data scientist without knowing how to code, but others disagree. A lot of algorithms have been developed and optimized in the field. You could argue that it is more important to understand how to use the algorithms than how to code them yourself. As the field grows, more platforms are available that automate much of the process. However, as it stands now, employers are primarily looking for people who can code, and you need basic programming skills. The<strong> data scientist </strong>role is continuing to evolve, so that might not be true in the future. The best advice would be to find the path that fits your skillset.</p><p><strong>What skills should a data scientist know?<br></strong>A data scientist requires many skills. They need a strong understanding of statistical analysis and mathematics, which are essential pillars of data science. A good understanding of these concepts will help you understand the basic premises of data science. Familiarity with machine learning is also important. Machine learning is a valuable tool to find patterns in large data sets. To manage large data sets, data scientists must be familiar with databases. Structured query language (SQL) is a must-have skill for data scientists. However, nonrelational databases (NoSQL) are growing in popularity, so a greater understanding of database structures is beneficial. The dominant programming language in Data Science is Python — although R is also popular. A basis in at least one of these languages is a good starting point. Finally, to communicate findings.</p><p><strong>Is data science a good career?<br></strong>The demand for data scientists is growing. We do not just have data scientists; we have data engineers, data administrators, and analytics managers. The jobs also generally pay well. This might make you wonder if it would be a promising career for you. A better understanding of the type of work a data scientist does can help you understand if it might be the path for you. First and foremost, you must think analytically. <strong>Data science from scratch</strong> is about gaining a more in-depth understanding of info through data. Do you fact-check information and enjoy diving into the statistics? Although the actual work may be quite technical, the findings still need to be communicated. Can you explain complex findings to someone who does not have a technical background? Many data scientists work in cross-functional teams and must share their results with people with very different backgrounds.<br><br><strong>What is python?</strong><br><strong>Machine learning python </strong>is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, <strong>Python bootcamp </strong>is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks.<br><strong>Python vs. R: What is the Difference?</strong><br>Python and R are two of today's most popular programming tools. When deciding between Python and R in <strong>data science</strong> , you need to think about your specific needs. On one hand, Python is relatively easy for beginners to learn, is applicable across many disciplines, has a strict syntax that will help you become a better coder, and is fast to process large datasets. On the other hand, R has over 10,000 packages for data manipulation, is capable of easily making publication-quality graphics, boasts superior capability for statistical modeling, and is more widely used in academia, healthcare, and finance.<br><strong>What does it mean that Python is object-oriented?</strong><br>Python is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports many <strong>data analysis</strong> programming approaches. Along with procedural and functional programming styles, Python also supports the object-oriented style of programming. In object-oriented programming, a developer completes a programming project by creating Python objects in code that represent objects in the actual world. These objects can contain both the data and functionality of the real-world object. To generate an object in Python you need a class. You can think of a class as a template. You create the template once, and then use the template to create as many objects as you need. Python classes have attributes to represent data and methods that add functionality. A class representing a car may have attributes like color, speed, and seats and methods like driving, steering, and stopping.<br><strong>What are the limitations of Python?</strong><br>Python is a widely used, general-purpose programming language, but it has some limitations. Because Python in <strong>machine learning</strong> is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, it is slow compared to a compiled, statically typed language like C. Therefore, Python is useful when speed is not that important. Python's dynamic type system also makes it use more memory than some other programming languages, so it is not suited to memory-intensive applications. The Python virtual engine that runs Python code runs single-threaded, making concurrency another limitation of the programming language. Though Python is popular for some types of game development, its higher memory and CPU usage limits its usage for high-quality 3D game development. That being said, computer hardware is getting better and better, and the speed and memory limitations of Python are getting less and less relevant.<br><strong>How is Python used?</strong><br>Python is a general programming language used widely across many industries and platforms. One common use of Python is scripting, which means automating tasks in the background. Many of the scripts that ship with Linux operating systems are Python scripts. Python is also a popular language for machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, and data science because its simple syntax makes it easy to quickly build real applications. You can use Python to create desktop applications. Many developers use it to write Linux desktop applications, and it is also an excellent choice for web and game development. Python web frameworks like Flask and Django are a popular choice for developing web applications. Recently, Python is also being used as a language for mobile development via the Kivy third-party library.<br><strong>What jobs use Python?<br></strong>Python is a popular language that is used across many industries and in many programming disciplines. DevOps engineers use Python to script website and server deployments. Web developers use Python to build web applications, usually with one of Python's popular web frameworks like Flask or Django. Data scientists and data analysts use Python to build machine learning models, generate data visualizations, and analyze big data. Financial advisors and quants (quantitative analysts) use Python to predict the market and manage money. Data journalists use Python to sort through information and create stories. Machine learning engineers use Python to develop neural networks and artificial intelligent systems.<br><strong>How do I learn Python on my own?</strong><br>Python has a simple syntax that makes it an excellent programming language for a beginner to learn. To learn Python on your own, you first must become familiar with the syntax. But you only need to know a little bit about Python syntax to get started writing real code; you will pick up the rest as you go. Depending on the purpose of using it, you can then find a good Python tutorial, book, or course that will teach you the programming language by building a complete application that fits your goals. If you want to develop games, then learn Python game development. If you're going to build web applications, you can find many courses that can teach you that, too. Udemy’s online courses are a great place to start if you want to learn Python on your own.</p><p><strong> You'll also get:</strong></p><ul><li><p> Lifetime Access to The Course</p></li><li><p> Fast &amp; Friendly Support in the Q&amp;A section</p></li><li><p> Udemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download</p></li></ul><p>Dive in now Python for Data Science: Learn Data Science From Scratch course</p><p>We offer&nbsp;<strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions.</p><p>See you in the <strong>Python for Data Science: Learn Data Science From Scratch </strong>course!</p>|scientific, bootcamp, mathematics, scientist, tutorials, django, scientists, javascript, science, python

But data alone cannot tell us much about the world around us. We need to interpret the information and discover hidden patterns. This is where <strong>data science </strong>comes in. <strong>Data science python </strong>uses algorithms to understand raw data. The main difference between data science and traditional data analysis is its focus on prediction. <strong>Python data science</strong> seeks to find patterns in data and use those patterns to predict future data. It draws on machine learning to process large amounts of data, discover patterns, and predict trends. <strong>Data science using python</strong> includes preparing, analyzing, and processing data. It draws from many scientific fields, and as a<strong> python for data science</strong>, it progresses by creating new algorithms to analyze data and validate current methods.</p><p><strong>What does a data scientist do?<br></strong>Data Scientists use machine learning to discover hidden patterns in large amounts of raw data to shed light on real problems. This requires several steps. First, they must identify a suitable problem. Next, they determine what data are needed to solve such a situation and figure out how to get the data. Once they obtain the data, they need to clean the data. The data may not be formatted correctly, it might have additional unnecessary data, it might be missing entries, or some data might be incorrect. Data Scientists must, therefore, make sure the data is clean before they analyze the data. To analyze the data, they use machine learning techniques to build models. Once they create a model, they test, refine, and finally put it into production.</p><p><strong>What are the most popular coding languages for data science?<br>Python for data science </strong>is the most popular programming language for data science. It is a universal language that has a lot of libraries available. It is also a good beginner language. R is also popular; however, it is more complex and designed for statistical analysis. It might be a good choice if you want to specialize in statistical analysis. You will want to know either Python or R and SQL. SQL is a query language designed for relational databases. Data scientists deal with large amounts of data, and they store a lot of that data in relational databases. Those are the three most-used programming languages. Other languages such as Java, C++, JavaScript, and Scala are also used, albeit less so. If you already have a background in those languages, you can explore the tools available in those languages. However, if you already know another programming language, you will likely be able to pick up.</p><p><strong>How long does it take to become a data scientist?<br></strong>This answer, of course, varies. The more time you devote to learning new skills, the faster you will learn. It will also depend on your starting place. If you already have a strong base in mathematics and statistics, you will have less to learn. If you have no background in statistics or advanced mathematics, you can still become a data scientist; it will just take a bit longer. Data science requires lifelong learning, so you will never really finish learning. A better question might be, How can I gauge whether I know enough to become a data scientist? Challenge yourself to complete <strong>data science projects</strong> using open data. The more you practice, the more you will learn, and the more confident you will become. Once you have several projects that you can point to as good examples of your skillset as a data scientist, you are ready to enter the field.</p><p><strong>How can ı learn data science on my own?</strong></p><p>It is possible to learn <strong>data science projects</strong> on your own, as long as you stay focused and motivated. Luckily, there are a lot of online courses and boot camps available. Start by determining what interests you about data science. If you gravitate to visualizations, begin learning about them. Starting with something that excites you will motivate you to take that first step. If you are not sure where you want to start, try starting with learning Python. It is an excellent introduction to programming languages and will be useful as a data scientist. Begin by working through tutorials or Udemy courses on the topic of your choice. Once you have developed a base in the skills that interest you, it can help to talk with someone in the field. Find out what skills employers are looking for and continue to learn those skills. When learning on your own, setting practical learning goals can keep you motivated.</p><p><strong>Does data science require coding?<br></strong>The jury is still out on this one. Some people believe that it is possible to become a data scientist without knowing how to code, but others disagree. A lot of algorithms have been developed and optimized in the field. You could argue that it is more important to understand how to use the algorithms than how to code them yourself. As the field grows, more platforms are available that automate much of the process. However, as it stands now, employers are primarily looking for people who can code, and you need basic programming skills. The<strong> data scientist </strong>role is continuing to evolve, so that might not be true in the future. The best advice would be to find the path that fits your skillset.</p><p><strong>What skills should a data scientist know?<br></strong>A data scientist requires many skills. They need a strong understanding of statistical analysis and mathematics, which are essential pillars of data science. A good understanding of these concepts will help you understand the basic premises of data science. Familiarity with machine learning is also important. Machine learning is a valuable tool to find patterns in large data sets. To manage large data sets, data scientists must be familiar with databases. Structured query language (SQL) is a must-have skill for data scientists. However, nonrelational databases (NoSQL) are growing in popularity, so a greater understanding of database structures is beneficial. The dominant programming language in Data Science is Python — although R is also popular. A basis in at least one of these languages is a good starting point. Finally, to communicate findings.</p><p><strong>Is data science a good career?<br></strong>The demand for data scientists is growing. We do not just have data scientists; we have data engineers, data administrators, and analytics managers. The jobs also generally pay well. This might make you wonder if it would be a promising career for you. A better understanding of the type of work a data scientist does can help you understand if it might be the path for you. First and foremost, you must think analytically. <strong>Data science from scratch</strong> is about gaining a more in-depth understanding of info through data. Do you fact-check information and enjoy diving into the statistics? Although the actual work may be quite technical, the findings still need to be communicated. Can you explain complex findings to someone who does not have a technical background? Many data scientists work in cross-functional teams and must share their results with people with very different backgrounds.<br><br><strong>What is python?</strong><br><strong>Machine learning python </strong>is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, <strong>Python bootcamp </strong>is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks.<br><strong>Python vs. R: What is the Difference?</strong><br>Python and R are two of today's most popular programming tools. When deciding between Python and R in <strong>data science</strong> , you need to think about your specific needs. On one hand, Python is relatively easy for beginners to learn, is applicable across many disciplines, has a strict syntax that will help you become a better coder, and is fast to process large datasets. On the other hand, R has over 10,000 packages for data manipulation, is capable of easily making publication-quality graphics, boasts superior capability for statistical modeling, and is more widely used in academia, healthcare, and finance.<br><strong>What does it mean that Python is object-oriented?</strong><br>Python is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports many <strong>data analysis</strong> programming approaches. Along with procedural and functional programming styles, Python also supports the object-oriented style of programming. In object-oriented programming, a developer completes a programming project by creating Python objects in code that represent objects in the actual world. These objects can contain both the data and functionality of the real-world object. To generate an object in Python you need a class. You can think of a class as a template. You create the template once, and then use the template to create as many objects as you need. Python classes have attributes to represent data and methods that add functionality. A class representing a car may have attributes like color, speed, and seats and methods like driving, steering, and stopping.<br><strong>What are the limitations of Python?</strong><br>Python is a widely used, general-purpose programming language, but it has some limitations. Because Python in <strong>machine learning</strong> is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, it is slow compared to a compiled, statically typed language like C. Therefore, Python is useful when speed is not that important. Python's dynamic type system also makes it use more memory than some other programming languages, so it is not suited to memory-intensive applications. The Python virtual engine that runs Python code runs single-threaded, making concurrency another limitation of the programming language. Though Python is popular for some types of game development, its higher memory and CPU usage limits its usage for high-quality 3D game development. That being said, computer hardware is getting better and better, and the speed and memory limitations of Python are getting less and less relevant.<br><strong>How is Python used?</strong><br>Python is a general programming language used widely across many industries and platforms. One common use of Python is scripting, which means automating tasks in the background. Many of the scripts that ship with Linux operating systems are Python scripts. Python is also a popular language for machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, and data science because its simple syntax makes it easy to quickly build real applications. You can use Python to create desktop applications. Many developers use it to write Linux desktop applications, and it is also an excellent choice for web and game development. Python web frameworks like Flask and Django are a popular choice for developing web applications. Recently, Python is also being used as a language for mobile development via the Kivy third-party library.<br><strong>What jobs use Python?<br></strong>Python is a popular language that is used across many industries and in many programming disciplines. DevOps engineers use Python to script website and server deployments. Web developers use Python to build web applications, usually with one of Python's popular web frameworks like Flask or Django. Data scientists and data analysts use Python to build machine learning models, generate data visualizations, and analyze big data. Financial advisors and quants (quantitative analysts) use Python to predict the market and manage money. Data journalists use Python to sort through information and create stories. Machine learning engineers use Python to develop neural networks and artificial intelligent systems.<br><strong>How do I learn Python on my own?</strong><br>Python has a simple syntax that makes it an excellent programming language for a beginner to learn. To learn Python on your own, you first must become familiar with the syntax. But you only need to know a little bit about Python syntax to get started writing real code; you will pick up the rest as you go. Depending on the purpose of using it, you can then find a good Python tutorial, book, or course that will teach you the programming language by building a complete application that fits your goals. If you want to develop games, then learn Python game development. If you're going to build web applications, you can find many courses that can teach you that, too. Udemy’s online courses are a great place to start if you want to learn Python on your own.<br><strong>What is R and why is it useful?</strong></p><p>The R programming language was created specifically for statistical programming. Many find it useful for data handling, cleaning, analysis, and representation. R is also a popular language for data science projects. Much of the data used for data science can be messy and complex. The programming language has features and libraries available geared toward cleaning up unorganized data and making complex data structures easier to handle that can't be found in other languages. It also provides powerful data visualization tools to help data scientists find patterns in large sets of data and present the results in expressive reports. Machine learning is another area where the R language is useful. R gives developers an extensive selection of machine learning libraries that will help them find trends in data and predict future events.</p><p><strong>What careers use R?</strong></p><p>R is a popular programming language for data science, business intelligence, and financial analysis. Academic, scientific, and non-profit researchers use the R language to glean answers from data. R is also widely used in market research and advertising to analyze the results of marketing campaigns and user data. The language is used in quantitative analysis, where its data analysis capabilities give financial experts the tools they need to manage portfolios of stocks, bonds, and other assets. Data scientists use R in many industries to turn data into insights and predict future trends with its machine learning capabilities. Data analysts use R to extract data, analyze it, and turn it into reports that can help enterprises make better business decisions. Data visualization experts use R to turn data into visually appealing graphs and charts.</p><p><strong>Is R difficult to learn?</strong></p><p>Whether R is hard to learn depends on your experience. After all, R is a programming language designed for mathematicians, statisticians, and business analysts who may have no coding experience. For some beginning users, it is relatively simple to learn R. It can have a learning curve if you are a business analyst who is only familiar with graphical user interfaces since R is a text-based programming language. But compared to other programming languages, users usually find R easier to understand. R also may have an unfamiliar syntax for programmers who are used to other programming languages, but once they learn the syntax, the learning process becomes more straightforward. Beginners will also find that having some knowledge of mathematics, statistics, and probabilities makes learning R easier.</p><p><strong>Python vs. R: What is the Difference?</strong></p><p>Python and R are two of today's most popular programming tools.

A class representing a car may have attributes like color, speed, and seats and methods like driving, steering, and stopping. The concept of combining data with functionality in an object is called encapsulation, a core concept in the object-oriented programming paradigm.</p><p><strong><em>Why would you want to take this course?</em></strong></p><p>Our answer is simple: The quality of teaching.</p><p>When you enroll, you will feel the OAK Academy's seasoned instructors' expertise.</p><p><strong><em>Fresh Content</em></strong></p><p> It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate and it’s crucial to stay on top of the latest knowledge.

The electric motor was invented way back in 1821, and the electrical circuit was mathematically analyzed in 1827. But factory electrification, household electrification, and railway electrification all started slowly several decades later.</p><p>Fast forward to today. It’s the same story with Artificial Intelligence (AI). The field of AI was formally founded in 1956. But it’s only now—more than six decades later—that AI is expected to revolutionize the way humanity will live and work in the coming decades.</p><p>Data science is a large field of study that covers data systems and processes. These systems and processes are aimed at maintaining data sets as well as getting meaning out of them. Machine Learning (ML), a branch of AI, is the concept that systems can automatically learn and adapt from experience without human intervention. ML, essentially, aims to equip machines with independent learning techniques.</p><p><strong>Data Science &amp; Machine Learning Full Course in 90 Hours</strong> is exhaustive and covers various topics in both these fields in great detail.</p><p>Data science specialists use a combination of algorithms, applications, principles, and tools to gain a real sense of random data clusters. You are probably aware that organizations worldwide are generating exponential amounts of data. So, monitoring and storing all this data becomes very difficult. This is where data science plays a vital role by focusing on data modeling and data warehousing.</p><p>Both AI and ML are important to data scientists because they can work equally well in both with ease.

You are also assured of the support of a dedicated instructor every step of the way. You can approach our team in case of any queries.</p><p>Course content:</p><p><strong>1. Python for Data Science and Data Analysis</strong></p><p>a. You start with problem-solving and finish with fancy indexing and plots in Matplotlib.</p><p>b. No prior knowledge in any computer science language is assumed.</p><p>c. Great fun with Python language.</p><p>d. Reasonable treatment of data science packages (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Sklearn).</p><p>e. After this course, you will be a competent Python programmer as well as a reasonable expert of data science packages (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib).</p><p>f. This section is designed to teach you programming in general also. Therefore, shifting from this language to any other language after this section is not difficult.</p><p><strong>2. Data Understanding and Data Visualization with Python</strong></p><p>a. This section deals with the in-depth treatment of data science packages both for data manipulation as well as data visualization.</p><p>b. While Section 1 focuses more on Python language, this section focuses completely on data science packages and their efficient use.</p><p>c. The packages covered in this section include NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Bokeh, Plotly, and Folium.</p><p>d. As far as we know, this is the most comprehensive section on data understanding and visualization among the available ones.</p><p>e. Further, this section is designed to reduce the dependency on core Python language to be treated independently, as well.</p><p>f. 2D and 3D visualizations, interactive visualizations, and geographic maps are also covered.</p><p>g. Proceeding in data science with being able to effectively play with the data using famous packages makes progress much worse, and this section addresses this concern.</p><p><strong>3. Mastering Probability and Statistics in Python</strong></p><p>a. Obviously, concepts in data science are not new. In fact, it is also believed that data science is merely a renamed version of Probability and Statistics. Well, without being biased to that extent, we will say that the practical nature of applications was uncovered earlier even though the theory traces back to Probability and Statistics.</p><p>b. One way or the other, knowing Probability and Statistics makes a significant theoretical as well as practical difference.</p><p>c. Most of the courses on Probability and Statistics, however, fail to link the data science practices and theory by merely focusing on the axiomatic treatment of the subject.</p><p>d. We build this section by keeping the practical needs of data science in mind as well as the importance of theory.</p><p>e. Wherever important, we deliberately explain and show the relationships by derivations and even through Python Code.</p><p>f. This section builds a very sound basis for understanding the classical concepts in data science as well as its more recent generalizations.</p><p>g. We start with the very basics of Probability, go through inference and estimations, link famous machine learning techniques with conditional probability, and finally, show that Deep Neural Networks indeed learn a probability function eventually.</p><p><strong>4. Machine Learning Crash Course</strong></p><p>a. Although several concepts, or even all, fall under the umbrella of Probability and Statistics, it turns out that most of the concepts have made their own practical place, mostly derived through engineering, with the name of Machine Learning. For example, the term “overfitting” is now referring to the area of machine learning.</p><p>b. Machine Learning brings its own set of practices to reach the demands of automation. Hence, mastering these concepts becomes inevitable.</p><p>c. This section is actually a quick walkthrough of the concepts in Machine Learning and focuses on all the theoretical as well as practical concepts.</p><p>d. We mostly cover applications using the Sklearn Python package and build machine learning pipelines in this section.</p><p>e. We also elaborate on more advanced areas of machine learning, which we later present as separate sections.</p><p><strong>5. Feature Engineering and Dimensionality Reduction with Python</strong></p><p>a. Knowing the sections you have covered thus far certainly brings you a huge clarity of the field. But there is still one thing that brings the improvements in the results with a reasonable margin, and that is data preprocessing or data preparation.</p><p>b. Most of the data science today relies on preparing the data suitable for machine learning models. An effective way of data preparation, most of the time, becomes a game-changer.</p><p>c. This section focuses on data preparation for machine learning models.</p><p>d. We build this section to provide an understanding of why selecting features and transforming features are important.</p><p>e. We also discuss practical issues with real data, like missing values and non-numeric data.</p><p>f. We discuss the performance improvements both in terms of execution time as well as the accuracy of the models.</p><p>g. We explain the required mathematical background in a simple way.</p><p>h. Finally, all the concepts are made more easily understandable by coding relevant examples in Python.</p><p><strong>6. Artificial Neural Networks with Python</strong></p><p>a. With the availability of a huge quantity of data as well as computation power, a relatively old machine learning model, Artificial Neural Network turns out to be the game-changer in data science.</p><p>b. Artificial Neural Network can approximate almost any pattern in the data. Further, it has a much greater data utilization capacity as compared to the more classical methods.</p><p>c. With the recent rise of ANNs, a lot of practical techniques are also discovered, particularly for ANNs.</p><p>d. Also, working with a large amount of data brings its own challenges for learning algorithms.</p><p>e. In this section, we address all these concerns and cover ANNs in depth.</p><p>f. We also introduce another framework, “TensorFlow,” for working in ANNs.</p><p>g. With this section in hand, you can now target much larger machine learning problems.</p><p><strong>7. Convolutional Neural Networks with Python</strong></p><p>a. ANNs, in its most basic form, is not that suitable for image data and for the problems in computer vision.</p><p>b. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are considered a game-changer in the field of computer vision. CNNs are not limited to images only. You’ll find them everywhere now, from audio processing to more advanced reinforcement learning (i.e., Resnets in AlphaZero). So, the understanding of CNNs becomes inevitable in all the fields of data science. Even most of the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) rely on CNNs nowadays.</p><p>c. In this section, you will to learn about:</p><p>i. The significance of CNNs in data science.</p><p>ii. The reasons to shift to CNNs from hand engineering (classical computer vision).</p><p>iii. The major concepts from the absolute beginning with complete unfolding with examples in Python.</p><p>iv. Practical explanation and <em>live</em> coding with Python.</p><p>v. Evolution of CNNs — LeNet (1990s) to MobileNets (2020s).</p><p>vi. Intricate details of CNNs including examples of training CNNs.</p><p>vii. TensorFlow (Google’s deep learning framework).</p><p>viii. The use and applications of CNNs (with implementations in framework TensorFlow) that are more recent and advanced in terms of accuracy and efficiency.</p><p>ix. The use and applications of pre-trained CNNs (with implementations in framework TensorFlow) for transfer learning on your own dataset.</p><p>x. Building your own applications for Human Face-Verification and Neural Style Transfer.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>After completing this course successfully, you will be able to:</strong></p><ul><li><p>· Relate the concepts, principles, and theories in <strong>Data Science &amp; Machine Learning</strong>.</p></li><li><p>· Understand the methodology of <strong>Data Science &amp; Machine Learning </strong>using real datasets.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Who this course is for:</strong></p><ul><li><p>· People who want to become perfect in their data speak.</p></li><li><p>· People who want to learn <strong>Data Science &amp; Machine Learning </strong>with real datasets in Data Science.</p></li><li><p>· People from a non-engineering background who want to enter the Data Science field.</p></li><li><p>· People who want to enter the Machine Learning field.</p></li><li><p>· Individuals who are passionate about numbers and programming.</p></li><li><p>· People who want to learn <strong>Data Science &amp; Machine Learning</strong> along with its implementation in realistic projects.</p></li><li><p>· Data Scientists.</p></li><li><p>· Business Analysts.</p></li></ul>|electrification, google, scientists, century, 1827, science, 1821, classical, decades, 2020s

Today, successful data professionals understand that they must advance past the traditional skills of analyzing large amounts of data, data mining, and programming skills. </p><p><strong>What Does a Data Scientist Do?</strong></p><p>In the past decade, data scientists have become necessary assets and are present in almost all organizations. These professionals are well-rounded, data-driven individuals with high-level technical skills who are capable of building complex quantitative algorithms to organize and synthesize large amounts of information used to answer questions and drive strategy in their organization. This is coupled with the experience in communication and leadership needed to deliver tangible results to various stakeholders across an organization or business.</p><p>Data scientists need to be curious and result-oriented, with exceptional industry-specific knowledge and communication skills that allow them to explain highly technical results to their non-technical counterparts. They possess a strong quantitative background in statistics and linear algebra as well as programming knowledge with focuses in data warehousing, mining, and modeling to build and analyze algorithms.</p><p>Glassdoor ranked data scientist as the #1 Best Job in America in 2018 for the third year in a row. 4 As increasing amounts of data become more accessible, large tech companies are no longer the only ones in need of data scientists. The growing demand for data science professionals across industries, big and small, is being challenged by a shortage of qualified candidates available to fill the open positions.</p><p>The need for data scientists shows no sign of slowing down in the coming years.

With over 4,500 open positions listed on Glassdoor, data science professionals with the appropriate experience and education have the opportunity to make their mark in some of the most forward-thinking companies in the world.</p><p>So, Data Science is primarily used to make decisions and predictions making use of predictive causal analytics, prescriptive analytics (predictive plus decision science) and machine learning.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Predictive causal analytics – </strong>If you want a model which can predict the possibilities of a particular event in the future, you need to apply predictive causal analytics. Say, if you are providing money on credit, then the probability of customers making future credit payments on time is a matter of concern for you. Here, you can build a model which can perform predictive analytics on the payment history of the customer to predict if the future payments will be on time or not.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Prescriptive analytics:</strong> If you want a model which has the intelligence of taking its own decisions and the ability to modify it with dynamic parameters, you certainly need prescriptive analytics for it. This relatively new field is all about providing advice. In other terms, it not only predicts but suggests a range of prescribed actions and associated outcomes.<br>The best example for this is Google’s self-driving car which I had discussed earlier too. The data gathered by vehicles can be used to train self-driving cars. You can run algorithms on this data to bring intelligence to it. This will enable your car to take decisions like when to turn, which path to take, when to slow down or speed up.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Machine learning for making predictions</strong> — If you have transactional data of a finance company and need to build a model to determine the future trend, then machine learning algorithms are the best bet. This falls under the paradigm of supervised learning. It is called supervised because you already have the data based on which you can train your machines. For example, a fraud detection model can be trained using a historical record of fraudulent purchases.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Machine learning for pattern discovery</strong> — If you don’t have the parameters based on which you can make predictions, then you need to find out the hidden patterns within the dataset to be able to make meaningful predictions. This is nothing but the unsupervised model as you don’t have any predefined labels for grouping. The most common algorithm used for pattern discovery is Clustering.<br>Let’s say you are working in a telephone company and you need to establish a network by putting towers in a region. Then, you can use the clustering technique to find those tower locations which will ensure that all the users receive optimum signal strength.</p></li></ul><p><strong>||&nbsp;DEEP&nbsp;LEARNING&nbsp;||</strong></p><p>Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example. Deep learning is a key technology behind driverless cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign, or to distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost. It is the key to voice control in consumer devices like phones, tablets, TVs, and hands-free speakers. Deep learning is getting lots of attention lately and for good reason. It’s achieving results that were not possible before.</p><p>In deep learning, a computer model learns to perform classification tasks directly from images, text, or sound. Deep learning models can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, sometimes exceeding human-level performance. Models are trained by using a large set of labeled data and neural network architectures that contain many layers.</p><p>How does deep learning attain such impressive results?</p><p>In a word, accuracy. Deep learning achieves recognition accuracy at higher levels than ever before. This helps consumer electronics meet user expectations, and it is crucial for safety-critical applications like driverless cars. Recent advances in deep learning have improved to the point where deep learning outperforms humans in some tasks like classifying objects in images.</p><p>While deep learning was first theorized in the 1980s, there are two main reasons it has only recently become useful:</p><ol><li><p>Deep learning requires large amounts of <strong>labeled data</strong>. For example, driverless car development requires millions of images and thousands of hours of video.</p></li><li><p>Deep learning requires substantial <strong>computing power</strong>. High-performance GPUs have a parallel architecture that is efficient for deep learning. When combined with clusters or cloud computing, this enables development teams to reduce training time for a deep learning network from weeks to hours or less.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Examples of Deep Learning at Work</strong></p><p>Deep learning applications are used in industries from automated driving to medical devices.</p><p>Automated Driving: Automotive researchers are using deep learning to automatically detect objects such as stop signs and traffic lights. In addition, deep learning is used to detect pedestrians, which helps decrease accidents.</p><p>Aerospace and Defense: Deep learning is used to identify objects from satellites that locate areas of interest, and identify safe or unsafe zones for troops.</p><p>Medical Research: Cancer researchers are using deep learning to automatically detect cancer cells. Teams at UCLA built an advanced microscope that yields a high-dimensional data set used to train a deep learning application to accurately identify cancer cells.</p><p>Industrial Automation: Deep learning is helping to improve worker safety around heavy machinery by automatically detecting when people or objects are within an unsafe distance of machines.</p><p>Electronics: Deep learning is being used in automated hearing and speech translation. For example, home assistance devices that respond to your voice and know your preferences are powered by deep learning applications.</p><p><strong>What's the Difference Between Machine Learning and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Deep learning is a specialized form of machine learning. A machine learning workflow starts with relevant features being manually extracted from images. The features are then used to create a model that categorizes the objects in the image. With a deep learning workflow, relevant features are automatically extracted from images. In addition, deep learning performs “end-to-end learning” – where a network is given raw data and a task to perform, such as classification, and it learns how to do this automatically.</p><p>Another key difference is deep learning algorithms scale with data, whereas shallow learning converges. Shallow learning refers to machine learning methods that plateau at a certain level of performance when you add more examples and training data to the network.</p><p>A key advantage of deep learning networks is that they often continue to improve as the size of your data increases.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>||&nbsp;MACHINE&nbsp;LEARNING&nbsp;||</strong></p><p><strong>What is the definition of machine learning?</strong></p><p>Machine-learning algorithms use statistics to find patterns in massive* amounts of data. And data, here, encompasses a lot of things—numbers, words, images, clicks, what have you. If it can be digitally stored, it can be fed into a machine-learning algorithm.</p><p>Machine learning is the process that powers many of the services we use today—recommendation systems like those on Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify; search engines like Google and Baidu; social-media feeds like Facebook and Twitter; voice assistants like Siri and Alexa. The list goes on.</p><p>In all of these instances, each platform is collecting as much data about you as possible—what genres you like watching, what links you are clicking, which statuses you are reacting to—and using machine learning to make a highly educated guess about what you might want next. Or, in the case of a voice assistant, about which words match best with the funny sounds coming out of your mouth.</p><p><strong>WHY IS MACHINE LEARNING SO SUCCESSFUL?</strong></p><p>While machine learning is not a new technique, interest in the field has exploded in recent years.</p><p>This resurgence comes on the back of a series of breakthroughs, with deep learning setting new records for accuracy in areas such as speech and language recognition, and computer vision.</p><p>What's made these successes possible are primarily two factors, one being the vast quantities of images, speech, video and text that is accessible to researchers looking to train machine-learning systems.</p><p>But even more important is the availability of vast amounts of parallel-processing power, courtesy of modern graphics processing units (GPUs), which can be linked together into clusters to form machine-learning powerhouses.</p><p>Today anyone with an internet connection can use these clusters to train machine-learning models, via cloud services provided by firms like Amazon, Google and Microsoft.</p><p>As the use of machine-learning has taken off, so companies are now creating specialized hardware tailored to running and training machine-learning models. An example of one of these custom chips is Google's Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), the latest version of which accelerates the rate at which machine-learning models built using Google's TensorFlow software library can infer information from data, as well as the rate at which they can be trained.</p><p>These chips are not just used to train models for Google DeepMind and Google Brain, but also the models that underpin Google Translate and the image recognition in Google Photo, as well as services that allow the public to build machine learning models using Google's TensorFlow Research Cloud. The second generation of these chips was unveiled at Google's I/O conference in May last year, with an array of these new TPUs able to train a Google machine-learning model used for translation in half the time it would take an array of the top-end GPUs, and the recently announced third-generation TPUs able to accelerate training and inference even further.</p><p>As hardware becomes increasingly specialized and machine-learning software frameworks are refined, it's becoming increasingly common for ML tasks to be carried out on consumer-grade phones and computers, rather than in cloud datacenters. In the summer of 2018, Google took a step towards offering the same quality of automated translation on phones that are offline as is available online, by rolling out local neural machine translation for 59 languages to the Google Translate app for iOS and Android.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>||Natural Language Processing||</strong></p><p>Large volumes of textual data</p><p>Natural language processing helps computers communicate with humans in their own language and scales other language-related tasks. For example, NLP makes it possible for computers to read text, hear speech, interpret it, measure sentiment and determine which parts are important.</p><p>Today’s machines can analyze more language-based data than humans, without fatigue and in a consistent, unbiased way. Considering the staggering amount of unstructured data that’s generated every day, from medical records to social media, automation will be critical to fully analyze text and speech data efficiently.</p><p>Structuring a highly unstructured data source</p><p>Human language is astoundingly complex and diverse. We express ourselves in infinite ways, both verbally and in writing. Not only are there hundreds of languages and dialects, but within each language is a unique set of grammar and syntax rules, terms and slang. When we write, we often misspell or abbreviate words, or omit punctuation. When we speak, we have regional accents, and we mumble, stutter and borrow terms from other languages.</p><p>While supervised and unsupervised learning, and specifically deep learning, are now widely used for modeling human language, there’s also a need for syntactic and semantic understanding and domain expertise that are not necessarily present in these machine learning approaches. NLP is important because it helps resolve ambiguity in language and adds useful numeric structure to the data for many downstream applications, such as speech recognition or text analytics.</p><p>How does NLP work?</p><p>Breaking down the elemental pieces of language</p><p>Natural language processing includes many different techniques for interpreting human language, ranging from statistical and machine learning methods to rules-based and algorithmic approaches. We need a broad array of approaches because the text- and voice-based data varies widely, as do the practical applications.</p><p>Basic NLP tasks include tokenization and parsing, lemmatization/stemming, part-of-speech tagging, language detection and identification of semantic relationships. If you ever diagramed sentences in grade school, you’ve done these tasks manually before.</p><p>In general terms, NLP tasks break down language into shorter, elemental pieces, try to understand relationships between the pieces and explore how the pieces work together to create meaning.</p><p>These underlying tasks are often used in higher-level NLP capabilities, such as:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Content categorization</strong>. A linguistic-based document summary, including search and indexing, content alerts and duplication detection.</p></li><li><p><strong>Topic discovery and modeling.</strong> Accurately capture the meaning and themes in text collections, and apply advanced analytics to text, like optimization and forecasting.</p></li><li><p><strong>Contextual extraction.</strong> Automatically pull structured information from text-based sources.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sentiment analysis.</strong> Identifying the mood or subjective opinions within large amounts of text, including average sentiment and opinion mining.</p></li><li><p><strong>Speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversion.</strong> Transforming voice commands into written text, and vice versa.</p></li><li><p><strong>Document summarization.</strong> Automatically generating synopses of large bodies of text.</p></li><li><p><strong>Machine translation. </strong>Automatic translation of text or speech from one language to another.</p></li></ul><p><br>In all these cases, the overarching goal is to take raw language input and use linguistics and algorithms to transform or enrich the text in such a way that it delivers greater value.</p><p><strong>|| R Language ||</strong></p><p><strong><br>What is R?</strong></p><p><strong>R</strong> is a programming language developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in 1993. R possesses an extensive catalog of statistical and graphical methods. It includes machine learning algorithms, linear regression, time series, statistical inference to name a few. Most of the R libraries are written in R, but for heavy computational tasks, C, C++ and Fortran codes are preferred.</p><p>R is not only entrusted by academic, but many large companies also use R programming language, including Uber, Google, Airbnb, Facebook and so on.</p><p>Data analysis with R is done in a series of steps; programming, transforming, discovering, modeling and communicate the results</p><ul><li><p><strong>Program</strong>: R is a clear and accessible programming tool</p></li><li><p><strong>Transform</strong>: R is made up of a collection of libraries designed specifically for data science</p></li><li><p><strong>Discover</strong>: Investigate the data, refine your hypothesis and analyze them</p></li><li><p><strong>Model</strong>: R provides a wide array of tools to capture the right model for your data</p></li><li><p><strong>Communicate</strong>: Integrate codes, graphs, and outputs to a report with R Markdown or build Shiny apps to share with the world</p></li></ul><p><strong>What is R used for?</strong></p><ul><li><p>Statistical inference</p></li><li><p>Data analysis</p></li><li><p>Machine learning algorithm</p></li></ul><p><strong>R package</strong></p><p>The primary uses of R is and will always be, statistic, visualization, and machine learning.

4569288|Mastering Data Visualization: Theory and Foundations [2022]|1099|/course/mastering-data-visualization/|datascience|0|4.7|en|Clara Granell, PhD|<p>Welcome to <strong>Mastering Data Visualization</strong>! In this course, you're going to learn about the <strong>Theory and Foundations of Data Visualization</strong> so that you can create <strong>amazing charts that are informative, true to the data, and communicatively effective</strong>. </p><p>Have you noticed there are more and more charts generated every day?&nbsp;If you turn on the TV, there's a bar chart telling you the evolution of COVID, if you go on Twitter, boom! a lot of line charts displaying the evolution of the price of gas. In newspapers, lots and lots of infographics telling you about the most recent discovery... The reason for that is that now we have <strong>lots of data</strong>, and the most natural way to communicate data is in visual form: that is, through Data Visualization. But, have you noticed all of the mistakes in those visualizations?&nbsp;I have to tell you, <strong>many of the charts that I see regularly have one problem or another</strong>. Maybe their color choices are confusing, they chose the wrong type of chart, or they are displaying data in a distorted way. </p><p>Actually, that happens because <strong>more and more professional roles now require to present data visually, but there's few training on how to do it correctly</strong>. This course aims to solve this gap. If there's one thing I can promise you is that, <strong>after completing this course, you'll be looking at charts at a completely different way</strong>. You will be able to distinguish good and bad visualizations, and, more importantly, you will be able to tell when a graph is lying and how to correct it. </p><p><strong>If you need to analyze, present or communicate data professionally at some point, this course is a must.</strong> Actually, even if you don't need to actually draw plots for a living, this course is hugely useful. After all, we are all consumers of data visualizations, and we need to identify when charts are lying to us.&nbsp;(As an example, my mother attended one of my classes and now she's spotting mistakes in a lot of the media she sees everyday!)</p><p>I really encourage you to deepen your knowledge on Data Visualization. It's not a difficult topic, and we will start from the basics. You don't need any previous knowledge. I'll teach you everything you need to know along the way and we'll go straight to the point. No rambling. <strong>I really hope to see you in class!</strong></p>|evolution, mastering, covid, tv, everyday, boom, informative, regularly, discovery, twitter
1151632|Deep Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks|1099|/course/deeplearning/|datascience|0|4.5|en|Kirill Eremenko|<p>*** As seen on Kickstarter ***</p><p>Artificial intelligence is growing exponentially. There is no doubt about that. Self-driving cars are clocking up millions of miles, IBM Watson is diagnosing patients better than armies of doctors and Google Deepmind's AlphaGo beat the World champion at Go - a game where intuition plays a key role.  </p><p>But the further AI advances, the more complex become the problems it needs to solve. And only Deep Learning can solve such complex problems and that's why it's at the heart of Artificial intelligence.  </p><p><strong>--- Why Deep Learning A-Z? ---</strong>  </p><p>Here are five reasons we think Deep Learning A-Z™ really is different, and stands out from the crowd of other training programs out there:  </p><p><strong>1. ROBUST STRUCTURE </strong>  </p><p>The first and most important thing we focused on is giving the course a robust structure. Deep Learning is very broad and complex and to navigate this maze you need a clear and global vision of it.   </p><p>That's why we grouped the tutorials into two volumes, representing the two fundamental branches of Deep Learning: Supervised Deep Learning and Unsupervised Deep Learning. With each volume focusing on three distinct algorithms, we found that this is the best structure for mastering Deep Learning.  </p><p><strong>2. INTUITION TUTORIALS</strong>  </p><p>So many courses and books just bombard you with the theory, and math, and coding... But they forget to explain, perhaps, the most important part: <strong>why you are doing what you are doing. </strong>And that's how this course is so different. We focus on developing an intuitive <em>*feel*</em> for the concepts behind Deep Learning algorithms.  </p><p>With our intuition tutorials you will be confident that you understand all the techniques on an instinctive level. And once you proceed to the hands-on coding exercises you will see for yourself how much more meaningful your experience will be. This is a game-changer.  </p><p><strong>3. EXCITING PROJECTS</strong>  </p><p>Are you tired of courses based on over-used, outdated data sets?  </p><p>Yes? Well then you're in for a treat.  </p><p>Inside this class we will work on Real-World datasets, to solve Real-World business problems. (Definitely not the boring iris or digit classification datasets that we see in every course). In this course we will solve six real-world challenges:  </p><ul><li>Artificial Neural Networks to solve a Customer Churn problem  </li><li>Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Recognition  </li><li>Recurrent Neural Networks to predict Stock Prices  </li><li>Self-Organizing Maps to investigate Fraud  </li><li>Boltzmann Machines to create a Recomender System  </li><li>Stacked Autoencoders* to take on the challenge for the <strong>Netflix $1 Million prize</strong>  </li></ul><p><em>*Stacked Autoencoders is a brand new technique in Deep Learning which didn't even exist a couple of years ago. We haven't seen this method explained anywhere else in sufficient depth.</em>  </p><p><strong>4. HANDS-ON CODING </strong>  </p><p>In Deep Learning A-Z™ we code together with you. Every practical tutorial starts with a blank page and we write up the code from scratch. This way you can follow along and understand exactly how the code comes together and what each line means.   </p><p>In addition, we will purposefully structure the code in such a way so that you can download it and apply it in your own projects. Moreover, we explain step-by-step where and how to modify the code to insert YOUR dataset, to tailor the algorithm to your needs, to get the output that you are after.   </p><p>This is a course which naturally extends into your career.  </p><p><strong>5. IN-COURSE SUPPORT</strong>  </p><p>Have you ever taken a course or read a book where you have questions but cannot reach the author?   </p><p>Well, this course is different. We are fully committed to making this the most disruptive and powerful Deep Learning course on the planet. With that comes a responsibility to constantly be there when you need our help.  </p><p>In fact, since we physically also need to eat and sleep we have put together a team of professional Data Scientists to help us out. Whenever you ask a question you will get a response from us within 48 hours maximum.   </p><p>No matter how complex your query, we will be there. The bottom line is we want you to succeed.   </p><p><strong>--- The Tools ---</strong>  </p><p>Tensorflow and Pytorch are the two most popular open-source libraries for Deep Learning. In this course you will learn both!  </p><p>TensorFlow was developed by Google and is used in their speech recognition system, in the new google photos product, gmail, google search and much more. Companies using Tensorflow include AirBnb, Airbus, Ebay, Intel, Uber and dozens more.   </p><p>PyTorch is as just as powerful and is being developed by researchers at Nvidia and leading universities: Stanford, Oxford, ParisTech. Companies using PyTorch include Twitter, Saleforce and Facebook.  </p><p>So which is better and for what?   </p><p>Well, in this course you will have an opportunity to work with both and understand when Tensorflow is better and when PyTorch is the way to go. Throughout the tutorials we compare the two and give you tips and ideas on which could work best in certain circumstances.  </p><p>The interesting thing is that both these libraries are barely over 1 year old. That's what we mean when we say that in this course we teach you the most cutting edge Deep Learning models and techniques.  </p><p><strong>--- More Tools ---</strong>  </p><p><em>Theano </em>is another open source deep learning library. It's very similar to Tensorflow in its functionality, but nevertheless we will still cover it.  </p><p><em>Keras </em>is an incredible library to implement Deep Learning models. It acts as a wrapper for Theano and Tensorflow. Thanks to Keras we can create powerful and complex Deep Learning models with only a few lines of code. This is what will allow you to have a global vision of what you are creating. Everything you make will look so clear and structured thanks to this library, that you will really get the intuition and understanding of what you are doing.  </p><p><strong>--- Even More Tools ---</strong>  </p><p><em>Scikit-learn </em>the most practical Machine Learning library. We will mainly use it:    </p><ul><li>to evaluate the performance of our models with the most relevant technique, k-Fold Cross Validation  </li><li>to improve our models with effective Parameter Tuning  </li><li>to preprocess our data, so that our models can learn in the best conditions  </li></ul><p>And of course, we have to mention the usual suspects. This whole course is based on Python and in every single section you will be getting hours and hours of invaluable hands-on practical coding experience.   </p><p>Plus, throughout the course we will be using Numpy to do high computations and manipulate high dimensional arrays, Matplotlib to plot insightful charts and Pandas to import and manipulate datasets the most efficiently.  </p><p><strong>--- Who Is This Course For? ---</strong>  </p><p>As you can see, there are lots of different tools in the space of Deep Learning and in this course we make sure to show you the most important and most progressive ones so that when you're done with Deep Learning A-Z™ your skills are on the cutting edge of today's technology.  </p><p><strong>If you are just starting out into Deep Learning, </strong>then you will find this course extremely useful. Deep Learning A-Z™ is structured around special coding blueprint approaches meaning that you won't get bogged down in unnecessary programming or mathematical complexities and instead you will be applying Deep Learning techniques from very early on in the course. You will build your knowledge from the ground up and you will see how with every tutorial you are getting more and more confident.  </p><p><strong>If you already have experience with Deep Learning, </strong>you will find this course refreshing, inspiring and very practical. Inside Deep Learning A-Z™ you will master some of the most cutting-edge Deep Learning algorithms and techniques (some of which didn't even exist a year ago) and through this course you will gain an immense amount of valuable hands-on experience with real-world business challenges. Plus, inside you will find inspiration to explore new Deep Learning skills and applications.  </p><p><strong>--- Real-World Case Studies ---</strong>  </p><p>Mastering Deep Learning is not just about knowing the intuition and tools, it's also about being able to apply these models to real-world scenarios and derive actual measurable results for the business or project. That's why in this course we are introducing six exciting challenges:  </p><p><strong>#1 Churn Modelling Problem</strong>  </p><p>In this part you will be solving a data analytics challenge for a bank. You will be given a dataset with a large sample of the bank's customers. To make this dataset, the bank gathered information such as customer id, credit score, gender, age, tenure, balance, if the customer is active, has a credit card, etc. During a period of 6 months, the bank observed if these customers left or stayed in the bank.   </p><p>Your goal is to make an Artificial Neural Network that can predict, based on geo-demographical and transactional information given above, if any individual customer will leave the bank or stay (customer churn). Besides, you are asked to rank all the customers of the bank, based on their probability of leaving. To do that, you will need to use the right Deep Learning model, one that is based on a probabilistic approach.   </p><p>If you succeed in this project, you will create significant added value to the bank. By applying your Deep Learning model the bank may significantly reduce customer churn.  </p><p><strong>#2 Image Recognition</strong>  </p><p>In this part, you will create a Convolutional Neural Network that is able to detect various objects in images. We will implement this Deep Learning model to recognize a cat or a dog in a set of pictures. However, this model can be reused to detect anything else and we will show you how to do it - by simply changing the pictures in the input folder.   </p><p>For example, you will be able to train the same model on a set of brain images, to detect if they contain a tumor or not. But if you want to keep it fitted to cats and dogs, then you will literally be able to a take a picture of your cat or your dog, and your model will predict which pet you have. We even tested it out on Hadelin’s dog!  </p><p><strong>#3 Stock Price Prediction</strong>  </p><p>In this part, you will create one of the most powerful Deep Learning models. We will even go as far as saying that you will create the Deep Learning model closest to <em>“Artificial Intelligence”</em>. Why is that? Because this model will have long-term memory, just like us, humans.   </p><p>The branch of Deep Learning which facilitates this is Recurrent Neural Networks. Classic RNNs have short memory, and were neither popular nor powerful for this exact reason. But a recent major improvement in Recurrent Neural Networks gave rise to the popularity of LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory RNNs) which has completely changed the playing field. We are extremely excited to include these cutting-edge deep learning methods in our course!   </p><p>In this part you will learn how to implement this ultra-powerful model, and we will take the challenge to use it to predict the real Google stock price. A similar challenge has already been faced by researchers at Stanford University and we will aim to do at least as good as them.   </p><p><strong> #4 Fraud Detection</strong>  </p><p>According to a recent report published by Markets &amp; Markets the Fraud Detection and Prevention Market is going to be worth $33.19 Billion USD by 2021. This is a huge industry and the demand for advanced Deep Learning skills is only going to grow. That’s why we have included this case study in the course.    </p><p>This is the first part of Volume 2 - Unsupervised Deep Learning Models. The business challenge here is about detecting fraud in credit card applications. You will be creating a Deep Learning model for a bank and you are given a dataset that contains information on customers applying for an advanced credit card.   </p><p>This is the data that customers provided when filling the application form. Your task is to detect potential fraud within these applications. That means that by the end of the challenge, you will literally come up with an explicit list of customers who potentially cheated on their applications.  </p><p><strong>#5 &amp; 6 Recommender Systems</strong>  </p><p>From Amazon product suggestions to Netflix movie recommendations - good recommender systems are very valuable in today's World. And specialists who can create them are some of the top-paid Data Scientists on the planet.  </p><p>We will work on a dataset that has exactly the same features as the Netflix dataset: plenty of movies, thousands of users, who have rated the movies they watched. The ratings go from 1 to 5, exactly like in the Netflix dataset, which makes the Recommender System more complex to build than if the ratings were simply “Liked” or “Not Liked”.   </p><p>Your final Recommender System will be able to predict the ratings of the movies the customers didn’t watch. Accordingly, by ranking the predictions from 5 down to 1, your Deep Learning model will be able to recommend which movies each user should watch. Creating such a powerful Recommender System is quite a challenge so we will give ourselves two shots. Meaning we will build it with two different Deep Learning models.  </p><p>Our first model will be Deep Belief Networks, complex Boltzmann Machines that will be covered in Part 5. Then our second model will be with the powerful AutoEncoders, my personal favorites. You will appreciate the contrast between their simplicity, and what they are capable of.  </p><p>And you will even be able to apply it to yourself or your friends. The list of movies will be explicit so you will simply need to rate the movies you already watched, input your ratings in the dataset, execute your model and voila! The Recommender System will tell you exactly which movies you would love one night you if are out of ideas of what to watch on Netflix!    </p><p><strong>--- Summary ---</strong>  </p><p>In conclusion, this is an exciting training program filled with intuition tutorials, practical exercises and real-World case studies.   </p><p>We are super enthusiastic about Deep Learning and hope to see you inside the class!  </p><p>Kirill &amp; Hadelin  </p><p></p>|stanford, huge, pandas, intel, ibm, uber, google, nvidia, netflix, kickstarter

2406316|Breaking into Data Science and Machine Learning with Python|379|/course/breaking-in-to-data-science-with-python/|datascience|0|4.9|en|Dr. KM Mohsin|<p>Let me tell you my story. I graduated with my Ph. D. in computational nano-electronics but I have been working as a data scientist in most of my career. My undergrad and graduate major was in electrical engineering (EE) and minor in Physics. After first year of my job in Intel as a yield analysis engineer (now they changed the title to Data Scientist), I literally broke into data science by taking plenty of online classes. I took numerous interviews, completed tons of projects and finally I broke into data science. I consider this as one of very important achievement in my life. Without having a degree in computer science (CS) or a statistics I got my second job as a Data Scientist. Since then I have been working as a Data Scientist. </p><p><br></p><p>If I can break into data science without a CS or Stat degree I&nbsp;think you can do it too! </p><p><br></p><p>In this class allow me sharing my journey towards data science and let me help you breaking into data science. Of course it is not fair to say that after taking one course you will be a data scientist. However we need to start some where. A good start and a good companion can take us further.</p><p><br></p><p>We will definitely discuss Python, Pandas, NumPy, Sk-learn and all other most popular libraries out there. In this course we will also try to de-mystify important complex concepts of machine learning. Most of the lectures will be accompanied by code and practical examples. I will also use “white board” to explain the concepts which cannot be explained otherwise. A good data scientist should use white board for ideation, problem solving. I also want to mention that this course is not designed towards explaining all the math needed to “practice” machine learning.

4095378|Learn ggplot2 in R for Data Visualization|1099|/course/learn-ggplot2-in-r-for-data-viz/|datascience|0|4.7|en|Clara Granell, PhD|<p>In this course, I'm going to teach you <strong>how to use the ggplot2 package of R to draw amazing charts</strong> that are able to communicate what your data has to say in the most polished, professional way. </p><p>My name is<strong> Clara</strong> and I am a&nbsp;Complex Systems researcher and Data Visualization professor at the University. </p><p>Currently, <strong>ggplot2 is the best, most powerful tool for building professional graphics</strong>. First, because this is a package available in R, which is one of the most used programming languages for Data Science and related fields.&nbsp;So, it is very convenient to be able to produce graphics in the same environment where you already do all of your calculations. Second, because it is the most flexible tool to build graphs. So, even if you don't use R for your analyses, it is worth it to use ggplot2 to draw your plots, because there's no other tool that will give you the results that you can achieve using ggplot2.</p><p><strong>Right now, the top agencies for Data Visualization are using ggplot2 to present their data</strong>. But still, ggplot2 is a tool that not everybody knows how to use, because of its long learning curve. Because of this, some people turn to other tools, like for example, Microsoft Excel, a tool that is not genuinely made for Data Visualization purposes. So, why don't you take the amazing opportunity of learning ggplot2 now and standing out from the crowd? </p><p>When I started learning ggplot2 some years ago, I was a bit overwhelmed by the amount of functions and parameters, and also, I&nbsp;had never used R at the time. But I knew there wasn't any other comparable tool out there. So, I decided to learn it from the grounds, which took me a while! Of course you can watch some tutorials, and learn how to do certain kinds of plots, but I soon realized this wasn't enough to use ggplot in an independent, confindent manner. <strong>This course that&nbsp;I'm offering to you today is the course that I wished had existed when I was learning ggplot2</strong>. It would have saved me hours and hours of reading books, manuals, the documentation, and endless trial and error. </p><p>In this course I've followed <strong>a methodology that has proven to work over the years with my students at the University</strong>, which is: to truly master ggplot2 you need to learn its core: the grammar of graphics. But, learning this alone might be a little tough, so I've created a series of lessons that first cover a certain part of the grammar, and then we move on to learning how to draw particular plots. Both of these types of lessons are fully hands-on, so you won't be bored one second! Using this method, I've had great success with students that had never used R before, R beginners, and advanced R users.</p><p>I really encourage you to make the decision of starting to learn ggplot2, it'll be a skill that you'll use for years to come and which will make a great difference in your career. <strong>I promise you won't regret it. </strong>Actually,<strong> </strong>this is what my students say:&nbsp;This is the best course on R that I have done (<em>M.G</em>), This is a perfect course, might be the best I've seen in a long time (<em>A.M</em>), [I thought] that it was impossible for me to learn ggplot2 but this course showed me otherwise (<em>M.N</em>). <strong>Take their advice and join us!</strong></p><p>*This course covers the ggplot2 3.3 version&nbsp;(the latest release).</p>|university, tools, teach, learning, manuals, science, professional, microsoft, tutorials, professor

With this course, you can step into the world of data science.</p><p><strong>What is python?</strong><br><strong>Machine learning python </strong>is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, <strong>Python Bootcamp </strong>is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks.<br><strong>Python vs. R: What is the Difference?</strong><br>Python and R are two of today's most popular programming tools. When deciding between Python and R in <strong>data science</strong>, you need to think about your specific needs. On one hand, Python is relatively easy for beginners to learn, is applicable across many disciplines, has a strict syntax that will help you become a better coder, and is fast to process large datasets. On the other hand, R has over 10,000 packages for data manipulation, is capable of easily making publication-quality graphics, boasts superior capability for statistical modeling, and is more widely used in academia, healthcare, and finance.<br><strong>What does it mean that Python is object-oriented?</strong><br>Python is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports many <strong>data analysis</strong> programming approaches. Along with procedural and functional programming styles, Python also supports the object-oriented style of programming. In object-oriented programming, a developer completes a programming project by creating Python objects in code that represent objects in the actual world. These objects can contain both the data and functionality of the real-world object. To generate an object in Python you need a class. You can think of a class as a template. You create the template once, and then use the template to create as many objects as you need. Python classes have attributes to represent data and methods that add functionality. A class representing a car may have attributes like color, speed, and seats and methods like driving, steering, and stopping.<br><strong>What are the limitations of Python?</strong><br>Python is a widely used, general-purpose programming language, but it has some limitations. Because Python in <strong>machine learning</strong> is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, it is slow compared to a compiled, statically typed language like C. Therefore, Python is useful when speed is not that important. Python's dynamic type system also makes it use more memory than some other programming languages, so it is not suited to memory-intensive applications. The Python virtual engine that runs Python code runs single-threaded, making concurrency another limitation of the programming language. Though Python is popular for some types of game development, its higher memory and CPU usage limits its usage for high-quality 3D game development. That being said, computer hardware is getting better and better, and the speed and memory limitations of Python are getting less and less relevant.<br><strong>How is Python used?</strong><br>Python is a general programming language used widely across many industries and platforms. One common use of Python is scripting, which means automating tasks in the background. Many of the scripts that ship with Linux operating systems are Python scripts. Python is also a popular language for machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, and data science because its simple syntax makes it easy to quickly build real applications. You can use Python to create desktop applications. Many developers use it to write Linux desktop applications, and it is also an excellent choice for web and game development. Python web frameworks like Flask and Django are a popular choices for developing web applications. Recently, Python is also being used as a language for mobile development via the Kivy third-party library.<br><strong>What jobs use Python?<br></strong>Python is a popular language that is used across many industries and in many programming disciplines. DevOps engineers use Python to script website and server deployments. Web developers use Python to build web applications, usually with one of Python's popular web frameworks like Flask or Django. Data scientists and data analysts use Python to build machine learning models, generate data visualizations, and analyze big data. Financial advisors and quants (quantitative analysts) use Python to predict the market and manage money. Data journalists use Python to sort through information and create stories. Machine learning engineers use Python to develop neural networks and artificial intelligent systems.<br><strong>How do I learn Python on my own?</strong><br>Python has a simple syntax that makes it an excellent programming language for a beginner to learn. To learn Python on your own, you first must become familiar with the syntax. But you only need to know a little bit about Python syntax to get started writing real code; you will pick up the rest as you go. Depending on the purpose of using it, you can then find a good Python tutorial, book, or course that will teach you the programming language by building a complete application that fits your goals. If you want to develop games, then learn Python game development. If you're going to build web applications, you can find many courses that can teach you that, too. Udemy’s online courses are a great place to start if you want to learn Python on your own.<br><strong>What is R and why is it useful?</strong></p><p>The R programming language was created specifically for statistical programming. Many find it useful for data handling, cleaning, analysis, and representation. R is also a popular language for data science projects. Much of the data used for data science can be messy and complex. The programming language has features and libraries available geared toward cleaning up unorganized data and making complex data structures easier to handle that can't be found in other languages. It also provides powerful data visualization tools to help data scientists find patterns in large sets of data and present the results in expressive reports. Machine learning is another area where the R language is useful. R gives developers an extensive selection of machine learning libraries that will help them find trends in data and predict future events.</p><p><strong>What careers use R?</strong></p><p><strong>R is a popular programming language for data science</strong>, business intelligence, and financial analysis. Academic, scientific, and non-profit researchers use the R language to glean answers from data. R is also widely used in market research and advertising to analyze the results of marketing campaigns and user data. The language is used in quantitative analysis, where its data analysis capabilities give financial experts the tools they need to manage portfolios of stocks, bonds, and other assets. Data scientists use R in many industries to turn data into insights and predict future trends with its machine learning capabilities. Data analysts use R to extract data, analyze it, and turn it into reports that can help enterprises make better business decisions. Data visualization experts use R to turn data into visually appealing graphs and charts.</p><p><strong>Is R difficult to learn?</strong></p><p>Whether <strong>R </strong>is hard to learn depends on your experience. After all, R is a programming language designed for mathematicians, statisticians, and business analysts who may have no coding experience. For some beginning users, it is relatively simple to learn R. It can have a learning curve if you are a business analyst who is only familiar with graphical user interfaces since R is a text-based programming language. But compared to other programming languages, users usually find R easier to understand. R also may have an unfamiliar syntax for programmers who are used to other programming languages, but once they learn the syntax, the learning process becomes more straightforward. Beginners will also find that having some knowledge of mathematics, statistics, and probabilities makes learning R easier.</p><p><strong>What is machine learning?</strong></p><p>Machine learning describes systems that make predictions using a model trained on real-world data. For example, let's say we want to build a system that can identify if a cat is in a picture. We first assemble many pictures to train our machine learning model. During this training phase, we feed pictures into the model, along with information around whether they contain a cat. While training, the model learns patterns in the images that are the most closely associated with cats. This model can then use the patterns learned during training to predict whether the new images that it's fed contain a cat. In this particular example, we might use a neural network to learn these patterns, but machine learning can be much simpler than that. Even fitting a line to a set of observed data points, and using that line to make new predictions, counts as a machine learning model.</p><p><strong>What is machine learning used for?</strong></p><p>Machine learning is being applied to virtually every field today. That includes medical diagnoses, facial recognition, weather forecasts, image processing, and more. In any situation in which pattern recognition, prediction, and analysis are critical, machine learning can be of use. Machine learning is often a disruptive technology when applied to new industries and niches. Machine learning engineers can find new ways to apply machine learning technology to optimize and automate existing processes. With the right data, you can use machine learning technology to identify extremely complex patterns and yield highly accurate predictions.</p><p><strong>Does machine learning require coding?</strong></p><p>It's possible to use machine learning without coding, but building new systems generally requires code. For example, Amazon’s Rekognition service allows you to upload an image via a web browser, which then identifies objects in the image. This uses a pre-trained model, with no coding required. However, developing machine learning systems involves writing some Python code to train, tune, and deploy your models. It's hard to avoid writing code to pre-process the data feeding into your model. Most of the work done by a machine learning practitioner involves cleaning the data used to train the machine. They also perform “feature engineering” to find what data to use and how to prepare it for use in a machine learning model. Tools like AutoML and SageMaker automate the tuning of models. Often only a few lines of code can train a model and make predictions from it. An introductory understanding of Python will make you more effective in using machine learning systems.<br><strong>What is data science?<br></strong>We have more data than ever before. But data alone cannot tell us much about the world around us. We need to interpret the information and discover hidden patterns. This is where <strong>data science </strong>comes in. <strong>Data science python </strong>uses algorithms to understand raw data. The main difference between data science and traditional data analysis is its focus on prediction. <strong>Python data science</strong> seeks to find patterns in data and use those patterns to predict future data. It draws on machine learning to process large amounts of data, discover patterns, and predict trends. <strong>Data science using python</strong> includes preparing, analyzing, and processing data. It draws from many scientific fields, and as a<strong> python for data science</strong>, it progresses by creating new algorithms to analyze data and validate current methods.</p><p><strong>What does a data scientist do?<br></strong>Data Scientists use machine learning to discover hidden patterns in large amounts of raw data to shed light on real problems. This requires several steps. First, they must identify a suitable problem. Next, they determine what data are needed to solve such a situation and figure out how to get the data. Once they obtain the data, they need to clean the data. The data may not be formatted correctly, it might have additional unnecessary data, it might be missing entries, or some data might be incorrect. Data Scientists must, therefore, make sure the data is clean before they analyze the data. To analyze the data, they use machine learning techniques to build models. Once they create a model, they test, refine, and finally put it into production.</p><p><strong>What are the most popular coding languages for data science?<br>Python for data science </strong>is the most popular programming language for data science. It is a universal language that has a lot of libraries available. It is also a good beginner language. R is also popular; however, it is more complex and designed for statistical analysis. It might be a good choice if you want to specialize in statistical analysis. You will want to know either Python or R and SQL. SQL is a query language designed for relational databases. Data scientists deal with large amounts of data, and they store a lot of that data in relational databases. Those are the three most-used programming languages. Other languages such as Java, C++, JavaScript, and Scala are also used, albeit less so. If you already have a background in those languages, you can explore the tools available in those languages. However, if you already know another programming language, you will likely be able to pick up.</p><p><strong>How long does it take to become a data scientist?<br></strong>This answer, of course, varies. The more time you devote to learning new skills, the faster you will learn. It will also depend on your starting place. If you already have a strong base in mathematics and statistics, you will have less to learn. If you have no background in statistics or advanced mathematics, you can still become a data scientist; it will just take a bit longer. Data science requires lifelong learning, so you will never really finish learning. A better question might be, How can I gauge whether I know enough to become a data scientist? Challenge yourself to complete <strong>data science projects</strong> using open data. The more you practice, the more you will learn, and the more confident you will become. Once you have several projects that you can point to as good examples of your skillset as a data scientist, you are ready to enter the field.</p><p><strong>How can ı learn data science on my own?</strong></p><p>It is possible to learn <strong>data science projects</strong> on your own, as long as you stay focused and motivated. Luckily, there are a lot of online courses and boot camps available. Start by determining what interests you about data science. If you gravitate to visualizations, begin learning about them. Starting with something that excites you will motivate you to take that first step. If you are not sure where you want to start, try starting with learning Python. It is an excellent introduction to programming languages and will be useful as a data scientist. Begin by working through tutorials or Udemy courses on the topic of your choice. Once you have developed a base in the skills that interest you, it can help to talk with someone in the field. Find out what skills employers are looking for and continue to learn those skills. When learning on your own, setting practical learning goals can keep you motivated.</p><p><strong>Does data science require coding?<br></strong>The jury is still out on this one. Some people believe that it is possible to become a data scientist without knowing how to code, but others disagree. A lot of algorithms have been developed and optimized in the field. You could argue that it is more important to understand how to use the algorithms than how to code them yourself. As the field grows, more platforms are available that automate much of the process. However, as it stands now, employers are primarily looking for people who can code, and you need basic programming skills. The<strong> data scientist </strong>role is continuing to evolve, so that might not be true in the future. The best advice would be to find the path that fits your skillset.</p><p><strong>What skills should a data scientist know?<br></strong>A data scientist requires many skills. They need a strong understanding of statistical analysis and mathematics, which are essential pillars of data science. A good understanding of these concepts will help you understand the basic premises of data science. Familiarity with machine learning is also important. Machine learning is a valuable tool to find patterns in large data sets. To manage large data sets, data scientists must be familiar with databases. Structured query language (SQL) is a must-have skill for data scientists. However, nonrelational databases (NoSQL) are growing in popularity, so a greater understanding of database structures is beneficial. The dominant programming language in Data Science is Python — although R is also popular. A basis in at least one of these languages is a good starting point. Finally, to communicate findings.</p><p><strong>Is data science a good career?<br></strong>The demand for data scientists is growing. We do not just have data scientists; we have data engineers, data administrators, and analytics managers. The jobs also generally pay well. This might make you wonder if it would be a promising career for you. A better understanding of the type of work a data scientist does can help you understand if it might be the path for you. First and foremost, you must think analytically. <strong>Data science from scratch</strong> is about gaining a more in-depth understanding of info through data. Do you fact-check information and enjoy diving into the statistics? Although the actual work may be quite technical, the findings still need to be communicated. Can you explain complex findings to someone who does not have a technical background? Many data scientists work in cross-functional teams and must share their results with people with very different backgrounds.<br></p><p><strong><em>Why would you want to take this course?</em></strong></p><p>Our answer is simple: The quality of teaching.</p><p>When you enroll, you will feel the OAK Academy's seasoned instructors' expertise.</p><p><strong><em>Fresh Content</em></strong></p><p> It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate and it’s crucial to stay on top of the latest knowledge.

If you don’t have any <strong>previous experience,&nbsp;<em>not a problem</em></strong><em>!</em>&nbsp; This course is expertly designed to teach everyone from complete beginners, right through to professionals (&nbsp;as a refresher).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why Python?</strong></p><p>Python is a general-purpose, high-level and multi-purpose programming language. The best thing about the Python is, it supports a lot of today’s technology including vast libraries for twitter, data mining, scientific calculations, designing, back-end server for websites, engineering simulations, artificial learning, augmented reality and what not! Also, it supports all kinds of App development.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><strong>What is data science?<br></strong>We have more data than ever before. But data alone cannot tell us much about the world around us. We need to interpret the information and discover hidden patterns. This is where <strong>data science </strong>comes in. <strong>Data science python </strong>uses algorithms to understand raw data. The main difference between data science and traditional data analysis is its focus on prediction. <strong>Python data science</strong> seeks to find patterns in data and use those patterns to predict future data. It draws on machine learning to process large amounts of data, discover patterns, and predict trends. <strong>Data science using python</strong> includes preparing, analyzing, and processing data. It draws from many scientific fields, and as a<strong> python for data science</strong>, it progresses by creating new algorithms to analyze data and validate current methods.</p><p><strong>What does a data scientist do?<br></strong>Data Scientists use machine learning to discover hidden patterns in large amounts of raw data to shed light on real problems. This requires several steps. First, they must identify a suitable problem. Next, they determine what data are needed to solve such a situation and figure out how to get the data. Once they obtain the data, they need to clean the data. The data may not be formatted correctly, it might have additional unnecessary data, it might be missing entries, or some data might be incorrect. Data Scientists must, therefore, make sure the data is clean before they analyze the data. To analyze the data, they use machine learning techniques to build models. Once they create a model, they test, refine, and finally put it into production.</p><p><strong>What are the most popular coding languages for data science?<br>Python for data science </strong>is the most popular programming language for data science. It is a universal language that has a lot of libraries available. It is also a good beginner language. R is also popular; however, it is more complex and designed for statistical analysis. It might be a good choice if you want to specialize in statistical analysis. You will want to know either Python or R and SQL. SQL is a query language designed for relational databases. Data scientists deal with large amounts of data, and they store a lot of that data in relational databases. Those are the three most-used programming languages. Other languages such as Java, C++, JavaScript, and Scala are also used, albeit less so. If you already have a background in those languages, you can explore the tools available in those languages. However, if you already know another programming language, you will likely be able to pick up.</p><p><strong>How long does it take to become a data scientist?<br></strong>This answer, of course, varies. The more time you devote to learning new skills, the faster you will learn. It will also depend on your starting place. If you already have a strong base in mathematics and statistics, you will have less to learn. If you have no background in statistics or advanced mathematics, you can still become a data scientist; it will just take a bit longer. Data science requires lifelong learning, so you will never really finish learning. A better question might be, How can I gauge whether I know enough to become a data scientist? Challenge yourself to complete <strong>data science projects</strong> using open data. The more you practice, the more you will learn, and the more confident you will become. Once you have several projects that you can point to as good examples of your skillset as a data scientist, you are ready to enter the field.</p><p><strong>How can ı learn data science on my own?</strong></p><p>It is possible to learn <strong>data science projects</strong> on your own, as long as you stay focused and motivated. Luckily, there are a lot of online courses and boot camps available. Start by determining what interests you about data science. If you gravitate to visualizations, begin learning about them. Starting with something that excites you will motivate you to take that first step. If you are not sure where you want to start, try starting with learning Python. It is an excellent introduction to programming languages and will be useful as a data scientist. Begin by working through tutorials or Udemy courses on the topic of your choice. Once you have developed a base in the skills that interest you, it can help to talk with someone in the field. Find out what skills employers are looking for and continue to learn those skills. When learning on your own, setting practical learning goals can keep you motivated.</p><p><strong>Does data science require coding?<br></strong>The jury is still out on this one. Some people believe that it is possible to become a data scientist without knowing how to code, but others disagree. A lot of algorithms have been developed and optimized in the field. You could argue that it is more important to understand how to use the algorithms than how to code them yourself. As the field grows, more platforms are available that automate much of the process. However, as it stands now, employers are primarily looking for people who can code, and you need basic programming skills. The<strong> data scientist </strong>role is continuing to evolve, so that might not be true in the future. The best advice would be to find the path that fits your skill set.</p><p><strong>What skills should a data scientist know?<br></strong>A data scientist requires many skills. They need a strong understanding of statistical analysis and mathematics, which are essential pillars of data science. A good understanding of these concepts will help you understand the basic premises of data science. Familiarity with machine learning is also important. Machine learning is a valuable tool to find patterns in large data sets. To manage large data sets, data scientists must be familiar with databases. Structured query language (SQL) is a must-have skill for data scientists. However, nonrelational databases (NoSQL) are growing in popularity, so a greater understanding of database structures is beneficial. The dominant programming language in Data Science is Python — although R is also popular. A basis in at least one of these languages is a good starting point. Finally, to communicate findings.</p><p><strong>Is data science a good career?<br></strong>The demand for data scientists is growing. We do not just have data scientists; we have data engineers, data administrators, and analytics managers. The jobs also generally pay well. This might make you wonder if it would be a promising career for you. A better understanding of the type of work a data scientist does can help you understand if it might be the path for you. First and foremost, you must think analytically. <strong>Data science from scratch</strong> is about gaining a more in-depth understanding of info through data. Do you fact-check information and enjoy diving into the statistics? Although the actual work may be quite technical, the findings still need to be communicated. Can you explain complex findings to someone who does not have a technical background? Many data scientists work in cross-functional teams and must share their results with people with very different backgrounds.<br><br><strong>What is python?</strong><br><strong>Machine learning python </strong>is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, <strong>Python bootcamp </strong>is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks.<br><strong>Python vs. R: What is the Difference?</strong><br>Python and R are two of today's most popular programming tools. When deciding between Python and R in <strong>data science</strong> , you need to think about your specific needs. On one hand, Python is relatively easy for beginners to learn, is applicable across many disciplines, has a strict syntax that will help you become a better coder, and is fast to process large datasets. On the other hand, R has over 10,000 packages for data manipulation, is capable of easily making publication-quality graphics, boasts superior capability for statistical modeling, and is more widely used in academia, healthcare, and finance.<br><strong>What does it mean that Python is object-oriented?</strong><br>Python is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports many <strong>data analysis</strong> programming approaches. Along with procedural and functional programming styles, Python also supports the object-oriented style of programming. In object-oriented programming, a developer completes a programming project by creating Python objects in code that represent objects in the actual world. These objects can contain both the data and functionality of the real-world object. To generate an object in Python you need a class. You can think of a class as a template. You create the template once, and then use the template to create as many objects as you need. Python classes have attributes to represent data and methods that add functionality. A class representing a car may have attributes like color, speed, and seats and methods like driving, steering, and stopping.<br><strong>What are the limitations of Python?</strong><br>Python is a widely used, general-purpose programming language, but it has some limitations. Because Python in <strong>machine learning</strong> is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, it is slow compared to a compiled, statically typed language like C. Therefore, Python is useful when speed is not that important. Python's dynamic type system also makes it use more memory than some other programming languages, so it is not suited to memory-intensive applications. The Python virtual engine that runs Python code runs single-threaded, making concurrency another limitation of the programming language. Though Python is popular for some types of game development, its higher memory and CPU usage limits its usage for high-quality 3D game development. That being said, computer hardware is getting better and better, and the speed and memory limitations of Python are getting less and less relevant.<br><strong>How is Python used?</strong><br>Python is a general programming language used widely across many industries and platforms. One common use of Python is scripting, which means automating tasks in the background. Many of the scripts that ship with Linux operating systems are Python scripts. Python is also a popular language for machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, and data science because its simple syntax makes it easy to quickly build real applications. You can use Python to create desktop applications. Many developers use it to write Linux desktop applications, and it is also an excellent choice for web and game development. Python web frameworks like Flask and Django are a popular choice for developing web applications. Recently, Python is also being used as a language for mobile development via the Kivy third-party library.<br><strong>What jobs use Python?<br></strong>Python is a popular language that is used across many industries and in many programming disciplines. DevOps engineers use Python to script website and server deployments. Web developers use Python to build web applications, usually with one of Python's popular web frameworks like Flask or Django. Data scientists and data analysts use Python to build machine learning models, generate data visualizations, and analyze big data. Financial advisors and quants (quantitative analysts) use Python to predict the market and manage money. Data journalists use Python to sort through information and create stories. Machine learning engineers use Python to develop neural networks and artificial intelligent systems.<br><strong>How do I learn Python on my own?</strong><br>Python has a simple syntax that makes it an excellent programming language for a beginner to learn. To learn Python on your own, you first must become familiar with the syntax. But you only need to know a little bit about Python syntax to get started writing real code; you will pick up the rest as you go. Depending on the purpose of using it, you can then find a good Python tutorial, book, or course that will teach you the programming language by building a complete application that fits your goals. If you want to develop games, then learn Python game development. If you're going to build web applications, you can find many courses that can teach you that, too. Udemy’s online courses are a great place to start if you want to learn Python on your own. </p><p><strong>No prior knowledge is needed!</strong></p><p>Python doesn't need any prior knowledge to learn it and the <strong>Python code is easy to understand </strong>for beginners.</p><p><strong>What you will learn?</strong></p><p>In this course, we will start from the very beginning and go all the way to programming with hands-on examples.

3322248|Mathematics & Statistics of Machine Learning & Data Science|549|/course/mathematics-statistics-of-machine-learning-data-science/|datascience|0|4.5|en|Cinnamon TechX|<p><strong>&nbsp;DATA&nbsp;SCIENCE&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Data science continues to evolve as one of the most promising and in-demand career paths for skilled professionals. Today, successful data professionals understand that they must advance past the traditional skills of analyzing large amounts of data, data mining, and programming skills. </p><p><strong>What Does a Data Scientist Do?</strong></p><p>In the past decade, data scientists have become necessary assets and are present in almost all organizations. These professionals are well-rounded, data-driven individuals with high-level technical skills who are capable of building complex quantitative algorithms to organize and synthesize large amounts of information used to answer questions and drive strategy in their organization. This is coupled with the experience in communication and leadership needed to deliver tangible results to various stakeholders across an organization or business.</p><p>Data scientists need to be curious and result-oriented, with exceptional industry-specific knowledge and communication skills that allow them to explain highly technical results to their non-technical counterparts. They possess a strong quantitative background in statistics and linear algebra as well as programming knowledge with focuses in data warehousing, mining, and modeling to build and analyze algorithms.</p><p>Glassdoor ranked data scientist as the #1 Best Job in America in 2018 for the third year in a row. 4 As increasing amounts of data become more accessible, large tech companies are no longer the only ones in need of data scientists. The growing demand for data science professionals across industries, big and small, is being challenged by a shortage of qualified candidates available to fill the open positions.</p><p>The need for data scientists shows no sign of slowing down in the coming years. LinkedIn listed data scientist as one of the most promising jobs in 2017 and 2018, along with multiple data-science-related skills as the most in-demand by companies. </p><p>Where Do You Fit in Data Science?</p><p>Data is everywhere and expansive. A variety of terms related to mining, cleaning, analyzing, and interpreting data are often used interchangeably, but they can actually involve different skill sets and complexity of data.</p><p>Data Scientist</p><p>Data scientists examine which questions need answering and where to find the related data. They have business acumen and analytical skills as well as the ability to mine, clean, and present data. Businesses use data scientists to source, manage, and analyze large amounts of unstructured data. Results are then synthesized and communicated to key stakeholders to drive strategic decision-making in the organization.</p><p><strong>Skills needed: </strong>Programming skills (SAS, R, Python), statistical and mathematical skills, storytelling and data visualization, Hadoop, SQL, machine learning</p><p>Data Analyst</p><p>Data analysts bridge the gap between data scientists and business analysts. They are provided with the questions that need answering from an organization and then organize and analyze data to find results that align with high-level business strategy. Data analysts are responsible for translating technical analysis to qualitative action items and effectively communicating their findings to diverse stakeholders.</p><p><strong>Skills needed: </strong>Programming skills (SAS, R, Python), statistical and mathematical skills, data wrangling, data visualization</p><p>Data Engineer</p><p>Data engineers manage exponential amounts of rapidly changing data. They focus on the development, deployment, management, and optimization of data pipelines and infrastructure to transform and transfer data to data scientists for querying.</p><p><strong>Skills needed: </strong>Programming languages (Java, Scala), NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra DB), frameworks (Apache Hadoop)</p><p>Data Science Career Outlook and Salary Opportunities</p><p>Data science professionals are rewarded for their highly technical skill set with competitive salaries and great job opportunities at big and small companies in most industries. With over 4,500 open positions listed on Glassdoor, data science professionals with the appropriate experience and education have the opportunity to make their mark in some of the most forward-thinking companies in the world.</p><p>So, Data Science is primarily used to make decisions and predictions making use of predictive causal analytics, prescriptive analytics (predictive plus decision science) and machine learning.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Predictive causal analytics – </strong>If you want a model which can predict the possibilities of a particular event in the future, you need to apply predictive causal analytics. Say, if you are providing money on credit, then the probability of customers making future credit payments on time is a matter of concern for you. Here, you can build a model which can perform predictive analytics on the payment history of the customer to predict if the future payments will be on time or not.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Prescriptive analytics:</strong> If you want a model which has the intelligence of taking its own decisions and the ability to modify it with dynamic parameters, you certainly need prescriptive analytics for it. This relatively new field is all about providing advice. In other terms, it not only predicts but suggests a range of prescribed actions and associated outcomes.<br>The best example for this is Google’s self-driving car which I had discussed earlier too. The data gathered by vehicles can be used to train self-driving cars. You can run algorithms on this data to bring intelligence to it. This will enable your car to take decisions like when to turn, which path to take, when to slow down or speed up.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Machine learning for making predictions</strong> — If you have transactional data of a finance company and need to build a model to determine the future trend, then machine learning algorithms are the best bet. This falls under the paradigm of supervised learning. It is called supervised because you already have the data based on which you can train your machines. For example, a fraud detection model can be trained using a historical record of fraudulent purchases.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Machine learning for pattern discovery</strong> — If you don’t have the parameters based on which you can make predictions, then you need to find out the hidden patterns within the dataset to be able to make meaningful predictions. This is nothing but the unsupervised model as you don’t have any predefined labels for grouping. The most common algorithm used for pattern discovery is Clustering.<br>Let’s say you are working in a telephone company and you need to establish a network by putting towers in a region. Then, you can use the clustering technique to find those tower locations which will ensure that all the users receive optimum signal strength.</p></li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp;DEEP&nbsp;LEARNING&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example. Deep learning is a key technology behind driverless cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign, or to distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost. It is the key to voice control in consumer devices like phones, tablets, TVs, and hands-free speakers. Deep learning is getting lots of attention lately and for good reason. It’s achieving results that were not possible before.</p><p>In deep learning, a computer model learns to perform classification tasks directly from images, text, or sound. Deep learning models can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, sometimes exceeding human-level performance. Models are trained by using a large set of labeled data and neural network architectures that contain many layers.</p><p>How does deep learning attain such impressive results?</p><p>In a word, accuracy. Deep learning achieves recognition accuracy at higher levels than ever before. This helps consumer electronics meet user expectations, and it is crucial for safety-critical applications like driverless cars. Recent advances in deep learning have improved to the point where deep learning outperforms humans in some tasks like classifying objects in images.</p><p>While deep learning was first theorized in the 1980s, there are two main reasons it has only recently become useful:</p><ol><li><p>Deep learning requires large amounts of <strong>labeled data</strong>. For example, driverless car development requires millions of images and thousands of hours of video.</p></li><li><p>Deep learning requires substantial <strong>computing power</strong>. High-performance GPUs have a parallel architecture that is efficient for deep learning. When combined with clusters or cloud computing, this enables development teams to reduce training time for a deep learning network from weeks to hours or less.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Examples of Deep Learning at Work</strong></p><p>Deep learning applications are used in industries from automated driving to medical devices.</p><p>Automated Driving: Automotive researchers are using deep learning to automatically detect objects such as stop signs and traffic lights. In addition, deep learning is used to detect pedestrians, which helps decrease accidents.</p><p>Aerospace and Defense: Deep learning is used to identify objects from satellites that locate areas of interest, and identify safe or unsafe zones for troops.</p><p>Medical Research: Cancer researchers are using deep learning to automatically detect cancer cells. Teams at UCLA built an advanced microscope that yields a high-dimensional data set used to train a deep learning application to accurately identify cancer cells.</p><p>Industrial Automation: Deep learning is helping to improve worker safety around heavy machinery by automatically detecting when people or objects are within an unsafe distance of machines.</p><p>Electronics: Deep learning is being used in automated hearing and speech translation. For example, home assistance devices that respond to your voice and know your preferences are powered by deep learning applications.</p><p><strong>What's the Difference Between Machine Learning and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Deep learning is a specialized form of machine learning. A machine learning workflow starts with relevant features being manually extracted from images. The features are then used to create a model that categorizes the objects in the image. With a deep learning workflow, relevant features are automatically extracted from images. In addition, deep learning performs “end-to-end learning” – where a network is given raw data and a task to perform, such as classification, and it learns how to do this automatically.</p><p>Another key difference is deep learning algorithms scale with data, whereas shallow learning converges. Shallow learning refers to machine learning methods that plateau at a certain level of performance when you add more examples and training data to the network.</p><p>A key advantage of deep learning networks is that they often continue to improve as the size of your data increases.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;MACHINE&nbsp;LEARNING&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>What is the definition of machine learning?</strong></p><p>Machine-learning algorithms use statistics to find patterns in massive* amounts of data. And data, here, encompasses a lot of things—numbers, words, images, clicks, what have you. If it can be digitally stored, it can be fed into a machine-learning algorithm.</p><p>Machine learning is the process that powers many of the services we use today—recommendation systems like those on Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify; search engines like Google and Baidu; social-media feeds like Facebook and Twitter; voice assistants like Siri and Alexa. The list goes on.</p><p>In all of these instances, each platform is collecting as much data about you as possible—what genres you like watching, what links you are clicking, which statuses you are reacting to—and using machine learning to make a highly educated guess about what you might want next. Or, in the case of a voice assistant, about which words match best with the funny sounds coming out of your mouth.</p><p><strong>WHY IS MACHINE LEARNING SO SUCCESSFUL?</strong></p><p>While machine learning is not a new technique, interest in the field has exploded in recent years.</p><p>This resurgence comes on the back of a series of breakthroughs, with deep learning setting new records for accuracy in areas such as speech and language recognition, and computer vision.</p><p>What's made these successes possible are primarily two factors, one being the vast quantities of images, speech, video and text that is accessible to researchers looking to train machine-learning systems.</p><p>But even more important is the availability of vast amounts of parallel-processing power, courtesy of modern graphics processing units (GPUs), which can be linked together into clusters to form machine-learning powerhouses.</p><p>Today anyone with an internet connection can use these clusters to train machine-learning models, via cloud services provided by firms like Amazon, Google and Microsoft.</p><p>As the use of machine-learning has taken off, so companies are now creating specialized hardware tailored to running and training machine-learning models. An example of one of these custom chips is Google's Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), the latest version of which accelerates the rate at which machine-learning models built using Google's TensorFlow software library can infer information from data, as well as the rate at which they can be trained.</p><p>These chips are not just used to train models for Google DeepMind and Google Brain, but also the models that underpin Google Translate and the image recognition in Google Photo, as well as services that allow the public to build machine learning models using Google's TensorFlow Research Cloud. The second generation of these chips was unveiled at Google's I/O conference in May last year, with an array of these new TPUs able to train a Google machine-learning model used for translation in half the time it would take an array of the top-end GPUs, and the recently announced third-generation TPUs able to accelerate training and inference even further.</p><p>As hardware becomes increasingly specialized and machine-learning software frameworks are refined, it's becoming increasingly common for ML tasks to be carried out on consumer-grade phones and computers, rather than in cloud datacenters. In the summer of 2018, Google took a step towards offering the same quality of automated translation on phones that are offline as is available online, by rolling out local neural machine translation for 59 languages to the Google Translate app for iOS and Android.</p>|breakthroughs, educated, latest, discovery, researchers, decade, powerhouses, science, scientist, scientists

3827010|Data Science Methodology|549|/course/data-science-methodology/|datascience|0|4.8|en|Neena Sathi|<p>Data Science grew through our experiences with Business Intelligence or BI, a field that became popular in 1990s. However, the last 20 years have seen unprecedented improvement in our ability to take actions using Artificial Intelligence. As we adopt the BI methodologies to AI deployments, how will these methodologies morph to add considerations needed for model deployment, and machine learning.</p><p>Today’s Data Science work deals with big data. It introduces three major challenges:</p><ol><li><p>How to deal with large volumes of data. Data understanding and data preparation must deal with large scale observations about the population. In the world of BI on small samples, the art of data science was to find averages and trends using a sample and then projecting it using universal population measures such as census to project to the overall population. Most of the big data provides significant samples where such a projection may not be needed. However, bias and outliers become the real issues</p></li><li><p>Data is now available in high velocity. Using scoring engines, we can embed insights into high velocity. Data Science techniques offer significant real-time analytics techniques to make it possible. As you interact with a web site or a product, the marketer or services teams can provide help to you as a user. This is due to insight embedded in high velocity.</p></li><li><p>Most of the data is in speech, unstructured text or videos. This is high variety. How do we interpret an image of a driver license and extract driver license. Understanding and interpreting such data is now a central part of data science.</p></li></ol><p>As these deployed models ingest learning in real-time and adjust their models, it is important to monitor their performance for biases and inaccuracies. We need measurement and monitoring that is no longer project-based one-time activity. It is continuous, automated, and closely monitored. The methodology must be extended to include continuous measurement and monitoring.</p><p>The course describes 7 steps methodology for conducting data science /AI driven engagement.</p><ul><li><p>Step 1: Understand Use Case - We use illustrative examples and case studies to show the power of data science engagement and will provide strategies for defining use case and data science objectives.</p></li><li><p>Step 2: Understand Data - We will define various characteristics of big data and how one should go about understanding and selecting right data sources for a use case from data science perspective</p></li><li><p>Step 3: Prepare Data - How should one go about selecting, cleaning and constructing big data for data modeling purposes using analytics or AI techniques</p></li><li><p>Step 4: Develop Model - Once you have ingested structured and un-structured data from many sources, how do you go about building models to gain data insights using AI and Analytics</p></li><li><p>Step 5: Evaluate Model - How do you engage users and evaluate decisions? What measurements do you need on models?</p></li><li><p>Step 6: Deploy Model- How do you deploy your AI models and apply learning of AI system from production use for enhancing your model.</p></li><li><p>Step 7: Optimize Model - How would you fine-tune the model and optimize its performance over time using feedback from production use? &nbsp;What guide rails would you need to make sure field use does not result in biases or sabotage.</p></li></ul><p>If you are a developer and are interested in learning how to do a data science project using Python, we have designed another course titled Data Science in Action using Python.&nbsp; </p>|unprecedented, popular, developer, big, web, analytics, python, trends, science, 1990s

This course is not part of my deep learning series, so it doesn't contain any hard math - just straight up coding in Python. All the materials for this course are FREE.</p><p>After a brief discussion about what NLP is and what it can do, we will begin building very useful stuff. The first thing we'll build is a <strong>cipher decryption algorithm</strong>. These have applications in warfare and espionage. We will learn how to build and apply several useful NLP tools in this section, namely, <strong>character-level language models (using the Markov principle)</strong>, and <strong>genetic algorithms</strong>.</p><p>The second project, where we begin to use more traditional <strong>machine learning</strong>, is to build a <strong>spam detector</strong>. You likely get very little spam these days, compared to say, the early 2000s, because of systems like these.</p><p>Next we'll build a model for <strong>sentiment analysis </strong>in Python. This is something that allows us to assign a score to a block of text that tells us how positive or negative it is. People have used sentiment analysis on Twitter to <strong>predict the stock market</strong>.</p><p>We'll go over some practical tools and techniques like the NLTK (natural language toolkit) library and latent semantic analysis or LSA.</p><p>Finally, we end the course by building an <strong>article spinner</strong>. This is a very hard problem and even the most popular products out there these days don't get it right. These lectures are designed to just get you started and to give you ideas for how you might improve on them yourself. Once mastered, you can use it as an SEO, or search engine optimization tool. Internet marketers everywhere will love you if you can do this for them!</p><p>This course focuses on <strong>how to build and understand</strong>, not just how to use. Anyone can learn to use an API in 15 minutes after reading some documentation. It's not about remembering facts, it's about&nbsp;<strong>seeing for yourself via experimentation</strong>. It will teach you how to visualize what's happening in the model internally. If you want&nbsp;<strong>more</strong>&nbsp;than just a superficial look at machine learning models, this course is for you.<br></p><p>If you can't implement it, you don't understand it</p><ul><li><p>Or as the great physicist Richard Feynman said: What I cannot create, I do not understand.</p></li><li><p>My courses are the ONLY courses where you will learn how to implement machine learning algorithms from scratch</p></li><li><p>Other courses will teach you how to plug in your data into a library, but do you really need help with 3 lines of code?</p></li><li><p>After doing the same thing with 10 datasets, you realize you didn't learn 10 things. You learned 1 thing, and just repeated the same 3 lines of code 10 times...</p></li></ul><p><br></p>|lectures, algorithm, internet, toolkit, physicist, algorithms, library, science, math, python

Many find it useful for data handling, cleaning, analysis, and representation. R is also a popular language for data science projects. Much of the data used for data science can be messy and complex. The programming language has features and libraries available geared toward cleaning up unorganized data and making complex data structures easier to handle that can't be found in other languages. It also provides powerful data visualization tools to help data scientists find patterns in large sets of data and present the results in expressive reports. Machine learning is another area where the R language is useful. R gives developers an extensive selection of machine learning libraries that will help them find trends in data and predict future events.</p><p><strong>What careers use R?</strong></p><p>R is a popular programming language for data science, business intelligence, and financial analysis. Academic, scientific, and non-profit researchers use the R language to glean answers from data. R is also widely used in market research and advertising to analyze the results of marketing campaigns and user data. The language is used in quantitative analysis, where its data analysis capabilities give financial experts the tools they need to manage portfolios of stocks, bonds, and other assets. Data scientists use R in many industries to turn data into insights and predict future trends with its machine learning capabilities. Data analysts use R to extract data, analyze it, and turn it into reports that can help enterprises make better business decisions. Data visualization experts use R to turn data into visually appealing graphs and charts.</p><p><strong>Is R difficult to learn?<br></strong>Whether R is hard to learn depends on your experience. After all, R is a programming language designed for mathematicians, statisticians, and business analysts who may have no coding experience. For some beginning users, it is relatively simple to learn R. It can have a learning curve if you are a business analyst who is only familiar with graphical user interfaces since R is a text-based programming language. But compared to other programming languages, users usually find R easier to understand. R also may have an unfamiliar syntax for programmers who are used to other programming languages, but once they learn the syntax, the learning process becomes more straightforward. Beginners will also find that having some knowledge of mathematics, statistics, and probabilities makes learning R easier.</p><p><strong>What is data science?</strong></p><p>We have more data than ever before. But data alone cannot tell us much about the world around us. We need to interpret the information and discover hidden patterns. This is where data science comes in. Data science uses algorithms to understand raw data. The main difference between data science and traditional data analysis is its focus on prediction. Data science seeks to find patterns in data and use those patterns to predict future data. It draws on machine learning to process large amounts of data, discover patterns, and predict trends. Data science includes preparing, analyzing, and processing data. It draws from many scientific fields, and as a science, it progresses by creating new algorithms to analyze data and validate current methods.</p><p><strong>What does a data scientist do?</strong></p><p>Data Scientists use machine learning to discover hidden patterns in large amounts of raw data to shed light on real problems. This requires several steps. First, they must identify a suitable problem. Next, they determine what data are needed to solve such a situation and figure out how to get the data. Once they obtain the data, they need to clean the data. The data may not be formatted correctly, it might have additional unnecessary data, it might be missing entries, or some data might be incorrect. Data Scientists must, therefore, make sure the data is clean before they analyze the data. To analyze the data, they use machine learning techniques to build models. Once they create a model, they test, refine, and finally put it into production.</p><p><strong>What are the most popular coding languages for data science?</strong></p><p>Python is the most popular programming language for data science. It is a universal language that has a lot of libraries available. It is also a good beginner language. R is also popular; however, it is more complex and designed for statistical analysis. It might be a good choice if you want to specialize in statistical analysis. You will want to know either Python or R and SQL. SQL is a query language designed for relational databases. Data scientists deal with large amounts of data, and they store a lot of that data in relational databases. Those are the three most-used programming languages. Other languages such as Java, C++, JavaScript, and Scala are also used, albeit less so. If you already have a background in those languages, you can explore the tools available in those languages. However, if you already know another programming language, you will likely be able to pick up Python very quickly.</p><p><strong>How long does it take to become a data scientist?</strong></p><p>This answer, of course, varies. The more time you devote to learning new skills, the faster you will learn. It will also depend on your starting place. If you already have a strong base in mathematics and statistics, you will have less to learn. If you have no background in statistics or advanced mathematics, you can still become a data scientist; it will just take a bit longer. Data science requires lifelong learning, so you will never really finish learning. A better question might be, How can I gauge whether I know enough to become a data scientist? Challenge yourself to complete data science projects using open data. The more you practice, the more you will learn, and the more confident you will become. Once you have several projects that you can point to as good examples of your skillset as a data scientist, you are ready to enter the field.</p><p><strong><em>Fresh Content</em></strong></p><p> It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate and it’s crucial to stay on top of the latest knowledge.

Here’s a brief history:</p><ul><li><p>In 2016, Python replaced Java as the most popular language in colleges and universities and has never looked back</p></li><li><p>In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.</p></li><li><p>In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets’s annual poll of data scientists’ most used tools.</p></li><li><p>In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.</p></li><li><p>In 2019 IEEE Spectrum (world’s largest professional organization dedicated to applied science and engineering) has ranked Python at the top of the list of ‘top programming languages in 2019’</p></li><li><p>Tiobe analysts believe that within three to four years' time, Python will probably replace C and Java to become the most popular programming language in the world</p></li><li><p>In 2021, the Python programming language will celebrate its 30th anniversary. Completing three decades in the niche, Python gives most other programming languages a good thrashing, showing a 456% growth</p></li></ul><p>Data science experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it’s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.</p><p>According to Indeed, the average salary for a Data Scientist is $127,918.</p><p>The good news? That number is only expected to increase. The experts at IBM predicted a 28% increase in demand for data scientists by the year 2021.</p><p>So, the future is bright for data science, and Python is just one piece of the proverbial pie. Fortunately, learning Python and other programming fundamentals is as attainable as ever. </p><p>But remember – just because the steps are simple doesn’t mean you won’t have to put in the work. If you apply yourself and dedicate meaningful time to learning Python, you have the potential to not only pick up a new skill, but potentially bring your career to a new level.</p>|engineering, 2021, ieee, universities, java, science, scientist, ibm, scientists, python

For example, let's say we want to build a system that can identify if a cat is in a picture. We first assemble many pictures to train our machine learning model. During this training phase, we feed pictures into the model, along with information around whether they contain a cat. While training, the model learns patterns in the images that are the most closely associated with cats. This model can then use the patterns learned during training to predict whether the new images that it's fed contain a cat. In this particular example, we might use a neural network to learn these patterns, but machine learning can be much simpler than that. Even fitting a line to a set of observed data points, and using that line to make new predictions, counts as a machine learning model.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is machine learning used for?</strong></p><p>Machine learning is being applied to virtually every field today. That includes medical diagnoses, facial recognition, weather forecasts, image processing, and more. In any situation in which pattern recognition, prediction, and analysis are critical, machine learning can be of use. Machine learning is often a disruptive technology when applied to new industries and niches. Machine learning engineers can find new ways to apply machine learning technology to optimize and automate existing processes. With the right data, you can use machine learning technology to identify extremely complex patterns and yield highly accurate predictions.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Does machine learning require coding?</strong></p><p>It's possible to use machine learning without coding, but building new systems generally requires code. For example, Amazon’s Rekognition service allows you to upload an image via a web browser, which then identifies objects in the image. This uses a pre-trained model, with no coding required. However, developing machine learning systems involves writing some Python code to train, tune, and deploy your models. It's hard to avoid writing code to pre-process the data feeding into your model. Most of the work done by a machine learning practitioner involves cleaning the data used to train the machine. They also perform “feature engineering” to find what data to use and how to prepare it for use in a machine learning model. Tools like AutoML and SageMaker automate the tuning of models. Often only a few lines of code can train a model and make predictions from it. An introductory understanding of Python will make you more effective in using machine learning systems.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is the best language for machine learning?</strong></p><p>Python is the most used language in machine learning. Engineers writing machine learning systems often use Jupyter Notebooks and Python together. Jupyter Notebooks is a web application that allows experimentation by creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations, and more. Machine learning involves trial and error to see which hyperparameters and feature engineering choices work best. It's useful to have a development environment such as Python so that you don't need to compile and package code before running it each time. Python is not the only language choice for machine learning. Tensorflow is a popular framework for developing neural networks and offers a C++ API. There is a machine learning framework for C# called ML. NET. Scala or Java are sometimes used with Apache Spark to build machine learning systems that ingest massive data sets. You may find yourself using many different languages in machine learning, but Python is a good place to start.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What are the different types of machine learning?</strong></p><p>Machine learning is generally divided between supervised machine learning and unsupervised machine learning. In supervised machine learning, we train machine learning models on labeled data. For example, an algorithm meant to detect spam might ingest thousands of email addresses labeled 'spam' or 'not spam.' That trained model could then identify new spam emails even from data it's never seen. In unsupervised learning, a machine learning model looks for patterns in unstructured data. One type of unsupervised learning is clustering. In this example, a model could identify similar movies by studying their scripts or cast, then group the movies together into genres. This unsupervised model was not trained to know which genre a movie belongs to. Rather, it learned the genres by studying the attributes of the movies themselves. There are many techniques available within these two types of machine learning, for example deep learning, reinforcement learning, and more.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is machine learning a good career?</strong></p><p>Machine learning is one of the fastest-growing and most popular computer science careers today. Constantly growing and evolving, you can apply machine learning to a variety of industries, from shipping and fulfillment to medical sciences. Machine learning engineers work to create artificial intelligence that can better identify patterns and solve problems. The machine learning discipline frequently deals with cutting-edge, disruptive technologies. However, because it has become a popular career choice, it can also be competitive. Aspiring machine learning engineers can differentiate themselves from the competition through certifications, boot camps, code repository submissions, and hands-on experience.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is the difference between machine learning and artifical intelligence?</strong></p><p>Machine learning is a smaller subset of the broader spectrum of artificial intelligence. While artificial intelligence describes any intelligent machine that can derive information and make decisions, machine learning describes a method by which it can do so. Through machine learning, applications can derive knowledge without the user explicitly giving out the information. This is one of the first and early steps toward true artificial intelligence and is extremely useful for numerous practical applications. In machine learning applications, an AI is fed sets of information. It learns from these sets of information about what to expect and what to predict. But it still has limitations. A machine learning engineer must ensure that the AI is fed the right information and can use its logic to analyze that information correctly.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What skills should a machine learning engineer know?</strong></p><p>A machine learning engineer will need to be an extremely competent programmer with in-depth knowledge of computer science, mathematics, data science, and artificial intelligence theory. Machine learning engineers must be able to dig deep into complex applications and their programming. As with other disciplines, there are entry-level machine learning engineers and machine learning engineers with high-level expertise. Python and R are two of the most popular languages within the machine learning field.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is data science?</strong></p><p>We have more data than ever before. But data alone cannot tell us much about the world around us. We need to interpret the information and discover hidden patterns. This is where data science comes in. Data science uses algorithms to understand raw data. The main difference between data science and traditional data analysis is its focus on prediction. Data science seeks to find patterns in data and use those patterns to predict future data. It draws on machine learning to process large amounts of data, discover patterns, and predict trends. Data science includes preparing, analyzing, and processing data. It draws from many scientific fields, and as a science, it progresses by creating new algorithms to analyze data and validate current methods.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What does a data scientist do?</strong></p><p>Data Scientists use machine learning to discover hidden patterns in large amounts of raw data to shed light on real problems. This requires several steps. First, they must identify a suitable problem. Next, they determine what data are needed to solve such a situation and figure out how to get the data. Once they obtain the data, they need to clean the data. The data may not be formatted correctly, it might have additional unnecessary data, it might be missing entries, or some data might be incorrect. Data Scientists must, therefore, make sure the data is clean before they analyze the data. To analyze the data, they use machine learning techniques to build models. Once they create a model, they test, refine, and finally put it into production.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What are the most popular coding languages for data science?</strong></p><p>Python is the most popular programming language for data science. It is a universal language that has a lot of libraries available. It is also a good beginner language. R is also popular; however, it is more complex and designed for statistical analysis. It might be a good choice if you want to specialize in statistical analysis. You will want to know either Python or R and SQL. SQL is a query language designed for relational databases. Data scientists deal with large amounts of data, and they store a lot of that data in relational databases. Those are the three most-used programming languages. Other languages such as Java, C++, JavaScript, and Scala are also used, albeit less so. If you already have a background in those languages, you can explore the tools available in those languages. However, if you already know another programming language, you will likely be able to pick up Python very quickly.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How long does it take to become a data scientist?</strong></p><p>This answer, of course, varies. The more time you devote to learning new skills, the faster you will learn. It will also depend on your starting place. If you already have a strong base in mathematics and statistics, you will have less to learn. If you have no background in statistics or advanced mathematics, you can still become a data scientist; it will just take a bit longer. Data science requires lifelong learning, so you will never really finish learning. A better question might be, How can I gauge whether I know enough to become a data scientist? Challenge yourself to complete data science projects using open data. The more you practice, the more you will learn, and the more confident you will become. Once you have several projects that you can point to as good examples of your skillset as a data scientist, you are ready to enter the field.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How can I learn data science on my own?</strong></p><p>It is possible to learn data science on your own, as long as you stay focused and motivated. Luckily, there are a lot of online courses and boot camps available. Start by determining what interests you about data science. If you gravitate to visualizations, begin learning about them. Starting with something that excites you will motivate you to take that first step. If you are not sure where you want to start, try starting by learning Python. It is an excellent introduction to programming languages and will be useful as a data scientist. Begin by working through tutorials or Oak Academy courses on the topic of your choice. Once you have developed a base in the skills that interest you, it can help to talk with someone in the field. Find out what skills employers are looking for and continue to learn those skills. When learning on your own, setting practical learning goals can keep you motivated.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Does data science require coding?</strong></p><p>The jury is still out on this one. Some people believe that it is possible to become a data scientist without knowing how to code, but others disagree. A lot of algorithms have been developed and optimized in the field. You could argue that it is more important to understand how to use the algorithms than how to code them yourself. As the field grows, more platforms are available that automate much of the process. However, as it stands now, employers are primarily looking for people who can code, and you need basic programming skills. The data scientist role is continuing to evolve, so that might not be true in the future. The best advice would be to find the path that fits your skill set.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What skills should a data scientist know?</strong></p><p>A data scientist requires many skills. They need a strong understanding of statistical analysis and mathematics, which are essential pillars of data science. A good understanding of these concepts will help you understand the basic premises of data science. Familiarity with machine learning is also important. Machine learning is a valuable tool to find patterns in large data sets. To manage large data sets, data scientists must be familiar with databases. Structured query language (SQL) is a must-have skill for data scientists. However, nonrelational databases (NoSQL) are growing in popularity, so a greater understanding of database structures is beneficial. The dominant programming language in Data Science is Python — although R is also popular. A basis in at least one of these languages is a good starting point. Finally, to communicate findings, data scientists require knowledge of visualizations. Data visualizations allow them to share complex data in an accessible manner.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is data science a good career?</strong></p><p>The demand for data scientists is growing. We do not just have data scientists; we have data engineers, data administrators, and analytics managers. The jobs also generally pay well. This might make you wonder if it would be a promising career for you. A better understanding of the type of work a data scientist does can help you understand if it might be the path for you. First and foremost, you must think analytically. Data science is about gaining a more in-depth understanding of info through data. Do you fact-check information and enjoy diving into the statistics? Although the actual work may be quite technical, the findings still need to be communicated. Can you explain complex findings to someone who does not have a technical background? Many data scientists work in cross-functional teams and must share their results with people with very different backgrounds. If this sounds like a great work environment, then it might be a promising career for you.</p><p><br></p><p>With my up-to-date course, you will have a chance to keep yourself up-to-date and equip yourself with a range of Python programming skills.

In other words, web pages are composed of HTML, which is used to display text, images, or other resources through a web browser.</p><p>HTML is the basic building block of the web and actually isn’t a technical programming language. It is responsible for the structure of the website. </p><p>JavaScript is the number one programming language for internet applications. The basics of JavaScript are dealt with in detail and students are provided to test what they have learned with code quizzes prepared for each subject.</p><p><strong>Node.js</strong> is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. By learning growing web server technology, NodeJS, you can improve your skills, get a new job and you can build powerful, robust web applications.</p><p><strong>MongoDB</strong> is a cross-platform document-oriented <strong>NoSQL</strong> database program.

Because in today's JavaScript world, besides writing a code, you need to know how to debug this topic and be able to read every written JavaScript code.</p><p>The most important feature that distinguishes this course from the others is that it deals with the most basic issues about JavaScript in detail and helps students to put what they have learned in theory into practice.</p><p>In this course, we will start with HTML, which is the basis of web development and then we will continue to learn CSS and final learn JavaScript.</p><p><strong>JavaScript</strong> is one of the most ubiquitous programming languages on the planet, mostly because it's the backbone of interactive web applications. On top of that, JavaScript is a great language for beginners because it gives them a chance to write code that does something visual, which is exciting and helpful when you're just getting started as a programmer. Dynamic content is the hot topic in web development right now. Dynamic content refers to content that constantly changes and adapts to specific users whenever possible. For example, JavaScript can be used to determine if a website visitor is using a computer or a mobile device before deciding whether or not to render the mobile version of the website. It's these small things behind the scenes that create genuine value in using JavaScript to create dynamic web pages.</p><p>This course will take you<strong> from a beginner to a more experienced level. </strong>You will learn <strong>HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node.js and Mongo DB </strong>step by step with <strong>hands-on</strong> examples.</p><p><strong>In this course you will learn;</strong></p><ul><li><p>To create static HTML sites,</p></li><li><p>To create a beautiful, responsive landing page for anyone,</p></li><li><p>You will learn to use basic tags which are used commonly,</p></li><li><p>You will be able to prepare lists in different formats,</p></li><li><p>The difference in usage between block-level and inline elements in HTML,</p></li><li><p>The uses of HTML table, and by learning this you will be able to create different designs of your own,</p></li><li><p>To able to create commonly used user login and registration pages by learning the form structure,</p></li><li><p>And improve your knowledge step by step by learning the basics of CSS</p></li><li><p>To place pages in the easiest way by talking about all layout models in CSS.</p></li><li><p>To prepare web pages with Grid CSS and Flexbox features.</p></li><li><p>How you can operate on variables,</p></li><li><p>Boolean logic,</p></li><li><p>How to create a conditional statement,</p></li><li><p>How you can perform transactions with Loops,</p></li><li><p>How a function is created and why it needs arguments,</p></li><li><p>How Arrays and Objects, which are basic data structures, are created,</p></li><li><p>How DOM Manipulation is done,</p></li><li><p>You will have learned and have the opportunity to test what you have learned with the code quizzes in our course.</p></li><li><p>You'll learn how asynchronous code works in Node and the Node event loop, as well as how to use the event emitter, streams, buffers, pipes, and work with files. </p></li><li><p>We'll see how that leads to building a web server in Node with hands-on examples. </p></li><li><p>The logic behind MongoDB’s data storage</p></li><li><p>The most popular Object Data Modeling Library for MongoDB, Mongoose JS</p></li><li><p>Writing queries for creating, reading, updating, and deleting operations</p></li><li><p>Advanced Features of MongooseJS</p></li><li><p>The best testing framework for NodeJS, Mocha</p></li><li><p>Full stack web development</p></li><li><p>Javascript</p></li><li><p>nodeJs</p></li><li><p>mongodb</p></li><li><p>html css javascript</p></li><li><p>node.js</p></li><li><p>complete web development course</p></li><li><p>full stack javascript</p></li><li><p>html css</p></li><li><p>full stack developer</p></li></ul><p><strong>No prior knowledge is needed!</strong></p><p><strong>What is web development?</strong></p><p>Web development is a broad description of the tasks and technologies that go into creating a website. It can be as simple as making a static text-based website or as elaborate as developing an interactive dynamic website. You can break web development into two different categories: frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side). Frontend code executes on the user's computer. This can include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Backend code runs on the server — this commonly includes communicating with a database and often involves languages like Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP. Web development does not necessarily include the design process — it focuses on code. A web designer builds wireframes to mockup their vision for a website and then shares that with a developer. The developer is responsible for writing the code that implements the design.</p><p><strong>What are the steps to becoming a web developer?</strong></p><p>Some web developers will obtain a degree or certification in the field. However, most jobs don't require a specific degree or level of education, just demonstrated knowledge of the field. So, it is more important that you know how to show off your skills. You could highlight your skills through relevant work experience or a portfolio of past projects. You might also share code you have developed using a platform like GitHub, or participate in solution-based forums like StackOverflow that reward you for helping others. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the first three coding languages you'll need to learn to break into web development. You need these three essential elements to create a modern website and work as a frontend web developer. HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) specifies the content of the website and builds the backbone. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles the content. JavaScript controls the interactive elements of the website.</p><p><strong>How long does it take to become a web developer?</strong></p><p>The answer to this question will depend on you. The more time you spend developing your skills, the faster you can become a web developer. The good news is that web development generally uses light-weight code that is easier to learn than many other languages. If dedicated, you can learn the basics of web development in a couple of months. But good web developers never stop learning. A better question might be, What can I do to become a better web developer faster? The answer to this question is practice. Becoming familiar with coding helps tremendously, but there is also a less obvious benefit of practicing. The more you code, the more you will run into problems or find bugs in your code. A significant aspect of web development is solving problems and debugging code. The better you get at solving problems and tracking down bugs, the faster you will get at coding.</p><p><strong>What is JavaScript?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is a curly-braced, dynamically typed, prototype-based, object-oriented programming language. It started as the programming language for the web and is one of the three layers of standard web technologies — the other two being HTML and CSS. JavaScript allows you to create and control content dynamically on a web page without requiring a page reload. Web browsers are able to interpret it, and when triggered by events, modify the HTML and CSS of a web page with dynamic updates. JavaScript also uses asynchronous calls to fetch data from web services in the background. Although it was initially only used in web browsers, JavaScript engines have since been put to use as servers with Node.js, included in desktop application frameworks like Electron, and embedded in phone frameworks like Apache Cordova.</p><p><strong>Why is JavaScript important?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is the programming language that allows users to interact with the websites that they're visiting, making it a very important language for web developers to know. In the past, most developers focused on the backend; JavaScript was only relevant when they needed to use visual effects. As web development evolved and the focus shifted towards user experience, programmers started to rely on JavaScript for their frontend code heavily. Today, most sites use JavaScript to fetch and submit data, use logic, and generate HTML in browsers. JavaScript can also communicate asynchronously with data servers in the background without interrupting the user interaction in the foreground. These features make JavaScript not only an important language but a necessary language for modern web development.</p><p><strong>What are the main uses of JavaScript?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is a text-based programming language used for client- and server-side development. Web developers have used JavaScript since its inception to add simple interactivity to web pages like modals, animated elements, or image slideshows. While that is still one of its primary uses, Javascript has evolved to building complete web applications. SPAs, or single page applications, depend on JavaScript-based frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue to bring a desktop-like application experience to the browser. However, it's important to note that web browsers aren't places that make good use of the programming language. Javascript is also popular for building web services and back-end infrastructure with Node.js. React Native, Xamarin, Ionic, and NativeScript frameworks use JavaScript for developing phone apps as well.</p><p><strong>React vs. Angular vs. Vue: what is the best JavaScript framework?</strong></p><p>Choosing the best JavaScript framework for your web project depends on what you are looking for. React is a popular framework, which means you will find a lot of community support if you need help. It is also considered relatively easy to learn but is being developed at a rapid pace. Angular is a framework that makes data binding easy so that you can template an application faster. It also uses the RxJS library to simplify asynchronous programming and Typescript (which compiles to JavaScript) for a cleaner, less error-prone development process. Some cons of Angular are that it can have a steep learning curve and can be complex. Vue is a lightweight framework, so it is easy to learn, very performant, and flexible. Some cons of Vue are limited plugins, and its flexibility can lead to irregular code.</p><p><strong>What is JSON and what is it used for?</strong></p><p>Because of the evolution of the JavaScript language, JavaScript has a variety of techniques for creating objects. But, ultimately in the background, JavaScript is using a syntax called JSON. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a standard text-based format used to represent objects in JavaScript. The same basic types of data represented in Javascript can also be represented in JSON, including strings, numbers, arrays, booleans, and JavaScript objects. Although JSON is based on the JavaScript object, it is not just used in JavaScript. It is also used as a format to transfer data from a web browser to a server and vice versa because of the format's simplicity and small size. The JSON format is used in REST APIs for this purpose and has replaced XML as the standard format for many APIs. Because of this, just about any language you use will have a method of converting data into JSON to interact with REST APIs.</p><p><strong>What is AJAX and what is it used for?</strong></p><p>AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is a technology that developers use to create better, faster and more interactive web applications. AJAX uses XHTML for content, CSS to style the page, and JavaScript for controlling content dynamically. AJAX allows you to update a web page without reloading the page (this technique is called a “SPA” or Single Page Application), request data for the page after it has loaded, receive data after the page has loaded, and send data to the server in the background. Despite XML being part of the acronym that makes up AJAX, AJAX can send and receive data in any format, including JSON or plain text. While traditional web applications use synchronous methods to send and receive information from a web server, AJAX can use asynchronous API calls in the background without blocking activity in the browser. AJAX is a data-driven rather than a page-driven technology.</p><p><strong>How can I teach myself Javascript?</strong></p><p>One of the best ways to learn to write code is through an online course that teaches you how to write JavaScript with an instructor that will explain the code, what versions you should use, and why. Learning to develop a real-world application, with an instructor explaining in a step-by-step fashion, will teach you modern code techniques.</p><p><strong>What is the best IDE for Javascript?</strong></p><p>With all of the different JavaScript IDEs available, the best option depends on how you intend to use it, along with your personal preferences. Webstorm is a popular JavaScript IDE from JetBrains. It provides fast static code analysis, integrated testing, local history, code refactoring, and debugging. While the IDE requires a paid subscription, many developers swear by it because of its compatibility with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Those searching for a free option might prefer VS Code. This general-purpose, open-source IDE comes with IntelliSense, Git integration, and debugging features built-in. Many third-party extensions are available to add new language and programming features, making it one of the more flexible choices. Atom is another general-purpose IDE that is popular with JavaScript developers. It is also free, open-source, and has third-party extensions to add.</p><p><strong>What is HTML and why is it important?</strong></p><p>HTML stands for hyper-text markup language. Whether on a mobile device or a computer, every website that you browse is designed with HTML. HTML isn’t a “programming language,” but rather a “formatting language.” It tells a browser how to display text, images, and other media elements. When HTML was first developed, it was fairly simple. For example, the text on a page could be bolded, italicized, or underlined, and images could be resized and aligned. Today, HTML is much more complex and dynamic, allowing front-end developers to create any layout or setup they desire.</p><p><strong>Why is CSS and Javascript important for HTML?</strong></p><p>HTML is a formatting language, not a programming language. Javascript is often necessary to make HTML “dynamic.” While HTML can make it so that text is displayed on the screen, Javascript can update this text or make it move. Javascript is used for both front-end and back-end development, hand-in-hand with HTML, to create complex and attractive web designs. Meanwhile, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are used to organize the look and feel of a website and make the website easier to update and manipulate. Today, HTML, CSS, and Javascript are frequently used to develop responsive web designs — designs that react to a user’s environment for a better user experience.</p><p><strong>What is an HTML element and why is it important?</strong></p><p>HTML is designed on a modular basis, meaning every part of the web page has a specific “place.” An HTML element is a part of the page. Common HTML elements include “&lt;p&gt;” for a “paragraph” and “&lt;title&gt;” for the “title” of the page. In fact, the entirety of the HTML page is within the “&lt;html&gt;” element. Elements are begun and ended with tags, so a title would be written: “&lt;title&gt;This is the Title to the page.&lt;/title&gt;” Organizing code this way makes it easier to reference and control. Each element may also have characteristics. For instance, the “&lt;p&gt;” (paragraph) tag can be aligned in a certain direction. These are the basic building blocks of HTML and what most designers should learn first.</p><p><strong>Is HTML a programming language?</strong></p><p>HTML is not considered a programming language but rather a markup or formatting language. This is an important distinction. Formatting languages merely control how things are displayed on a visual level, whereas programming languages are more dynamic; they use logic gates to determine the behavior of a program. But there is some crossover. “DHTML,” for instance, refers to Dynamic HTML. It is a type of HTML augmented by Javascript to make it easier to adjust on the fly. Because HTML, Javascript, and CSS are so frequently used together, they can often be folded together, which can contribute to some confusion regarding whether HTML is a programming language.</p><p><strong>Is HTML hard to learn?</strong></p><p>HTML is known as one of the easiest languages to learn. It’s also one of the most ubiquitous. Many individuals interested in front-end, back-end, or full-stack development will learn HTML first. While HTML is largely intended for websites as a language, it is also used in many other programs. For example, when you create an email signature, you will usually be using HTML. Emails themselves use a combination of HTML and CSS. An advantage (and an occasional double-edged sword) to HTML is that it is very forgiving. You can get some HTML wrong, and your page will still be displayed, if not exactly how you want it to be.</p><p><strong>What jobs use HTML?</strong></p><p>Nearly any development or design job will require a cursory understanding of HTML. HTML has also evolved dramatically since it was originally developed; it is far more complex and standardized than before. Because of this, even those who have been experts in HTML during their career may need to undergo an HTML refresher periodically. Most jobs that require HTML will involve web design, web development, or layout and design. For example, someone who manages a content management system such as WordPress may not need to know any other programming languages but should still know HTML basics. Similarly, someone who formats online newsletters or an online magazine in an administrative capacity may not need to be a web designer or web developer but might need to understand the principles of HTML.</p><p><strong>What is responsive design?</strong></p><p>Responsive design is a new type of design intended to respond to the platform and environment that a user is on. When HTML was created, most people used PCs. Today, people can browse a website on a PC, phone, tablet, or even a game console. In the past, developers created separate sites for “desktop” and “mobile.” While it worked, it wasn't easy to maintain. Rather than creating separate sites, responsive design generates the site based on the environment it detects. This greatly reduces the amount of development and maintenance for the site. Responsive design is generally achieved with a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p><p><strong>What is Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)?</strong></p><p>CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used to style markup language. Markup languages include HTML, XHML, XML, and other XML-based languages. The most common use of CSS is to style HTML web pages. Although HTML doesn't need CSS to function, every web page would look the same without it. With CSS, you can target specific elements in a web page and change the look and arrangement on the page. CSS can make an embedded image small or cover the entire webpage as a background. You can enlarge a heading and apply a specific font to stand out from the rest of the page. Other things you can do with CSS include changing the color of elements, making elements float to one side of the page, and the list goes on. Every web page uses HTML, and every web page that has its unique look uses CSS.</p><p><strong>What careers use CSS?</strong></p><p>CSS applies to any career that involves web development. Web designers create the templates, mockups, and styles for a website using HTML and CSS that web developers use to build websites. Front-end web developers use CSS with HTML and JavaScript to build front-end web applications that run in the browser. Fullstack web developers create both the part of a web application that runs in the browser and on the server and need to know CSS to make the front-end look good. Content managers may need to know CSS to apply custom styles to articles they publish through a content management system like WordPress. Other job titles that may require you to know CSS include junior web developer, social media manager, website editor, content editor, website project manager, website support specialist, and webmaster.</p><p><strong>What skills should I have before learning CSS?</strong></p><p>Before learning CSS, you should know the basics of using a computer and how to use a text editor because that is where you will be writing CSS. You should also be familiar with web browsers for browsing the web because it will inform your use of CSS. Since you may end up using specialized tools to write CSS, you should know how to install software on your computer and create and manage files and folders on your computer so you can create a CSS project. Once you have those skills down, the next thing to learn is HTML; after all, CSS is nothing without an HTML page to apply styles. That should be the basics you need to know to get started with CSS.</p><p><strong>Why would you want to take this course?</strong>&nbsp; </p><p>Our answer is simple: The quality of teaching. </p><p>When you enroll, you will feel our seasoned instructors' expertise.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>Video and Audio Production Quality</strong></p><p>All our videos are created/produced as <strong>high-quality video and audio</strong> to provide you the best learning experience. </p><p>You will be,</p><ul><li><p>Seeing clearly</p></li><li><p>Hearing clearly</p></li><li><p>Moving through the course without distractions</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong> You'll also get:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Lifetime Access to The Course</p></li><li><p>Fast &amp; Friendly Support in the Q&amp;A section</p></li><li><p>Udemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download</p></li></ul><p>Dive in now <strong>Full Stack Web Development: Javascript, NodeJS, CSS and HTML </strong>course</p><p>We offer&nbsp;<strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions.</p><p>See you in the course!</p>|web, browser, nodejs, webmaster, apps, java, stackoverflow, html, html5, javascript

It can be as simple as making a static text-based website or as elaborate as developing an interactive dynamic website. You can break web development into two different categories: frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side). Frontend code executes on the user's computer. This can include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Backend code runs on the server — this commonly includes communicating with a database and often involves languages like Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP. Web development does not necessarily include the design process — it focuses on code. A web designer builds wireframes to mockup their vision for a website and then shares that with a developer. The developer is responsible for writing the code that implements the design.</p><p><strong>What are the steps to becoming a web developer?</strong></p><p>Some web developers will obtain a degree or certification in the field. However, most jobs don't require a specific degree or level of education, just demonstrated knowledge of the field. So, it is more important that you know how to show off your skills. You could highlight your skills through relevant work experience or a portfolio of past projects. You might also share code you have developed using a platform like GitHub, or participate in solution-based forums like StackOverflow that reward you for helping others. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the first three coding languages you'll need to learn to break into web development. You need these three essential elements to create a modern website and work as a frontend web developer. HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) specifies the content of the website and builds the backbone. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles the content. JavaScript controls the interactive elements of the website.</p><p><strong>How long does it take to become a web developer?</strong></p><p>The answer to this question will depend on you. The more time you spend developing your skills, the faster you can become a web developer. The good news is that web development generally uses light-weight code that is easier to learn than many other languages. If dedicated, you can learn the basics of web development in a couple of months. But good web developers never stop learning. A better question might be, What can I do to become a better web developer faster? The answer to this question is practice. Becoming familiar with coding helps tremendously, but there is also a less obvious benefit of practicing. The more you code, the more you will run into problems or find bugs in your code. A significant aspect of web development is solving problems and debugging code. The better you get at solving problems and tracking down bugs, the faster you will get at coding.</p><p><strong>What is JavaScript?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is a curly-braced, dynamically typed, prototype-based, object-oriented programming language. It started as the programming language for the web and is one of the three layers of standard web technologies — the other two being HTML and CSS. JavaScript allows you to create and control content dynamically on a web page without requiring a page reload. Web browsers are able to interpret it, and when triggered by events, modify the HTML and CSS of a web page with dynamic updates. JavaScript also uses asynchronous calls to fetch data from web services in the background. Although it was initially only used in web browsers, JavaScript engines have since been put to use as servers with Node.js, included in desktop application frameworks like Electron, and embedded in phone frameworks like Apache Cordova.</p><p><strong>Why is JavaScript important?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is the programming language that allows users to interact with the websites that they're visiting, making it a very important language for web developers to know. In the past, most developers focused on the backend; JavaScript was only relevant when they needed to use visual effects. As web development evolved and the focus shifted towards user experience, programmers started to rely on JavaScript for their frontend code heavily. Today, most sites use JavaScript to fetch and submit data, use logic, and generate HTML in browsers. JavaScript can also communicate asynchronously with data servers in the background without interrupting the user interaction in the foreground. These features make JavaScript not only an important language but a necessary language for modern web development.</p><p><strong>What is HTML and why is it important?</strong></p><p>HTML stands for hyper-text markup language. Whether on a mobile device or a computer, every website that you browse is designed with HTML. HTML isn’t a “programming language,” but rather a “formatting language.” It tells a browser how to display text, images, and other media elements. When HTML was first developed, it was fairly simple. For example, the text on a page could be bolded, italicized, or underlined, and images could be resized and aligned.

Although HTML doesn't need CSS to function, every web page would look the same without it. With CSS, you can target specific elements in a web page and change the look and arrangement on the page. CSS can make an embedded image small or cover the entire webpage as a background. You can enlarge a heading and apply a specific font to stand out from the rest of the page. Other things you can do with CSS include changing the color of elements, making elements float to one side of the page, and the list goes on. Every web page uses HTML, and every web page that has its unique look uses CSS.</p><p><strong>What careers use CSS?</strong></p><p>CSS applies to any career that involves web development.

Content managers may need to know CSS to apply custom styles to articles they publish through a content management system like WordPress. Other job titles that may require you to know CSS include junior web developer, social media manager, website editor, content editor, website project manager, website support specialist, and webmaster.</p><p><strong>What is React Native?</strong></p><p>Created by Facebook, React Native is an open-source-based mobile application framework that uses only JavaScript, making it capable of supporting both Android and iOS platforms. React, also known as React.js, saves time and effort for developers since they only need one programming language. The Native element allows developers to create JavaScript components to design software programs that run on various devices and platforms, such as smartphones, smart TVs, and laptops. With React Native, developers use the same concepts used in the original React framework to design a rich mobile user interface (UI) for various environments from existing components.</p><p><strong>What careers use React Native?</strong></p><p>Businesses that want to create mobile apps for iOS and Android simultaneously to ensure a seamless rollout need developers with a background in React Native. Careers in mobile app development that rely on React Native can count on professionals who can design and build stunning UIs in multiple platforms since it works hand-in-hand with platforms like Windows and tvOS. React Native developers are also vital to helping iOS, and Android companies update and otherwise modernize their apps with features like push notifications and animation for better effectiveness for mobile app subscribers. Developers with a background in React Native might work in full-stack development, designing and refining web-based games, websites, mobile apps, and more.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and Google Flutter?</strong></p><p>Google Flutter offers developers a UI toolkit that has some similarities to React Native. Flutter also has a native component and compiles web, mobile, and desktop applications from a single collection of source codes. Relying on existing code, Flutter is also a free and open-source framework for developers. Until this point, the two frameworks might sound similar. However, React Native is based on and only uses JavaScript, while Flutter only has a loose connection to the language. Google Flutter primarily uses a new language called Dart. Other differences between the two involve sourcing the tool itself and the installation process, setup and configuration, UI component and development, and community support.</p><p><strong>What is React?</strong></p><p>React is a front-end library in Javascript that was developed by Facebook. The simplest definition of React is that it is a user interface library used for building UI components for the web. But if that was all React did, it would be little more than a template library. Developers define components in React by using an HTML-like syntax called JSX. These encapsulated components manage their own state, making it simple to pass rich data to a component and keep the state of the application and its components out of the Document Object Model (DOM). These features give React components the ability to react dynamically and efficiently to changes in their state. A set of simple components in React can be composed into either simple single-page applications or large, complex web applications.</p><p><strong>What is React used for?</strong></p><p>React is an open-source JavaScript frontend library. Some developers consider it a frontend framework because it does more than standard libraries usually do. The most common use of React is to build dynamic user interfaces for single-page web applications. But the structure of React makes it useful for more than just creating websites. JSX, which is one feature of React, is a syntax extension for Javascript that provides a template for the HTML and manages the state of the element. But JSX can be used as an interface for things other than HTML. React Native uses React to build mobile applications. Here, JSX becomes an interface for mobile UIs instead of HTML. There are even a few libraries that use React and JSX to interact with and manage hardware like React Hardware.<br></p><p><strong>Video and Audio Production Quality</strong></p><p>All our videos are created/produced as <strong>high-quality video and audio</strong> to provide you the best learning experience. </p><p>You will be,</p><ul><li><p>Seeing clearly</p></li><li><p>Hearing clearly</p></li><li><p>Moving through the course without distractions</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong> You'll also get:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Lifetime Access to The Course</p></li><li><p>Fast &amp; Friendly Support in the Q&amp;A section</p></li><li><p>Udemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download</p></li></ul><p>Dive in now </p><p><strong>Full Stack Web Development with React, React Native, Bootstrap </strong>course</p><p>We offer&nbsp;<strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions.</p><p>See you in the course!</p>|programmer, toolkit, browsers, stackoverflow, html5, html, teaching, browser, javascript, webmaster

It can be as simple as making a static text-based website or as elaborate as developing an interactive dynamic website. You can break web development into two different categories: frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side). Frontend code executes on the user's computer. This can include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Backend code runs on the server — this commonly includes communicating with a database and often involves languages like Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP. Web development does not necessarily include the design process — it focuses on code. A web designer builds wireframes to mockup their vision for a website and then shares that with a developer. The developer is responsible for writing the code that implements the design.</p><p><strong>What are the steps to becoming a web developer?</strong></p><p>Some web developers will obtain a degree or certification in the field. However, most jobs don't require a specific degree or level of education, just demonstrated knowledge of the field. So, it is more important that you know how to show off your skills. You could highlight your skills through relevant work experience or a portfolio of past projects. You might also share code you have developed using a platform like GitHub, or participate in solution-based forums like StackOverflow that reward you for helping others. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the first three coding languages you'll need to learn to break into web development. You need these three essential elements to create a modern website and work as a frontend web developer. HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) specifies the content of the website and builds the backbone. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles the content. JavaScript controls the interactive elements of the website.</p><p><strong>How long does it take to become a web developer?</strong></p><p>The answer to this question will depend on you. The more time you spend developing your skills, the faster you can become a web developer. The good news is that web development generally uses light-weight code that is easier to learn than many other languages. If dedicated, you can learn the basics of web development in a couple of months. But good web developers never stop learning. A better question might be, What can I do to become a better web developer faster? The answer to this question is practice. Becoming familiar with coding helps tremendously, but there is also a less obvious benefit of practicing. The more you code, the more you will run into problems or find bugs in your code. A significant aspect of web development is solving problems and debugging code. The better you get at solving problems and tracking down bugs, the faster you will get at coding.</p><p><strong>What is JavaScript?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is a curly-braced, dynamically typed, prototype-based, object-oriented programming language. It started as the programming language for the web and is one of the three layers of standard web technologies — the other two being HTML and CSS. JavaScript allows you to create and control content dynamically on a web page without requiring a page reload. Web browsers are able to interpret it, and when triggered by events, modify the HTML and CSS of a web page with dynamic updates. JavaScript also uses asynchronous calls to fetch data from web services in the background. Although it was initially only used in web browsers, JavaScript engines have since been put to use as servers with Node.js, included in desktop application frameworks like Electron, and embedded in phone frameworks like Apache Cordova.</p><p><strong>Why is JavaScript important?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is the programming language that allows users to interact with the websites that they're visiting, making it a very important language for web developers to know. In the past, most developers focused on the backend; JavaScript was only relevant when they needed to use visual effects. As web development evolved and the focus shifted towards user experience, programmers started to rely on JavaScript for their frontend code heavily. Today, most sites use JavaScript to fetch and submit data, use logic, and generate HTML in browsers. JavaScript can also communicate asynchronously with data servers in the background without interrupting the user interaction in the foreground. These features make JavaScript not only an important language but a necessary language for modern web development.</p><p><strong>What are the main uses of JavaScript?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is a text-based programming language used for client- and server-side development. Web developers have used JavaScript since its inception to add simple interactivity to web pages like modals, animated elements, or image slideshows. While that is still one of its primary uses, Javascript has evolved to building complete web applications. SPAs, or single page applications, depend on JavaScript-based frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue to bring a desktop-like application experience to the browser. However, it's important to note that web browsers aren't places that make good use of the programming language. Javascript is also popular for building web services and back-end infrastructure with Node.js. React Native, Xamarin, Ionic, and NativeScript frameworks use JavaScript for developing phone apps as well.</p><p><strong>React vs. Angular vs. Vue: what is the best JavaScript framework?</strong></p><p>choosing the best JavaScript framework for your web project depends on what you are looking for. React is a popular framework, which means you will find a lot of community support if you need help. It is also considered relatively easy to learn but is being developed at a rapid pace. Angular is a framework that makes data binding easy so that you can template an application faster. It also uses the RxJS library to simplify asynchronous programming and Typescript (which compiles to JavaScript) for a cleaner, less error-prone development process. Some cons of Angular are that it can have a steep learning curve and can be complex. Vue is a lightweight framework, so it is easy to learn, very performant, and flexible. Some cons of Vue are limited plugins, and its flexibility can lead to irregular code.</p><p><strong>What is JSON and what is it used for?</strong></p><p>Because of the evolution of the JavaScript language, JavaScript has a variety of techniques for creating objects. But, ultimately in the background, JavaScript is using a syntax called JSON. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a standard text-based format used to represent objects in JavaScript. The same basic types of data represented in Javascript can also be represented in JSON, including strings, numbers, arrays, booleans, and JavaScript objects. Although JSON is based on the JavaScript object, it is not just used in JavaScript. It is also used as a format to transfer data from a web browser to a server and vice versa because of the format's simplicity and small size. The JSON format is used in REST APIs for this purpose and has replaced XML as the standard format for many APIs. Because of this, just about any language you use will have a method of converting data into JSON to interact with REST APIs.</p><p><strong>What is AJAX and what is it used for?</strong></p><p>AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is a technology that developers use to create better, faster and more interactive web applications. AJAX uses XHTML for content, CSS to style the page, and JavaScript for controlling content dynamically. AJAX allows you to update a web page without reloading the page (this technique is called a “SPA” or Single Page Application), request data for the page after it has loaded, receive data after the page has loaded, and send data to the server in the background. Despite XML being part of the acronym that makes up AJAX, AJAX can send and receive data in any format, including JSON or plain text. While traditional web applications use synchronous methods to send and receive information from a web server, AJAX can use asynchronous API calls in the background without blocking activity in the browser. AJAX is a data-driven rather than a page-driven technology.</p><p><strong>How can I teach myself Javascript?</strong></p><p>One of the best ways to learn to write code is through an online course that teaches you how to write JavaScript with an instructor that will explain the code, what versions you should use, and why. Learning to develop a real-world application, with an instructor explaining in a step-by-step fashion, will teach you modern code techniques.</p><p><strong>What is the best IDE for Javascript?</strong></p><p>With all of the different JavaScript IDEs available, the best option depends on how you intend to use it, along with your personal preferences. Webstorm is a popular JavaScript IDE from JetBrains. It provides fast static code analysis, integrated testing, local history, code refactoring, and debugging. While the IDE requires a paid subscription, many developers swear by it because of its compatibility with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Those searching for a free option might prefer VS Code. This general-purpose, open-source IDE comes with IntelliSense, Git integration, and debugging features built-in. Many third-party extensions are available to add new language and programming features, making it one of the more flexible choices. Atom is another general-purpose IDE that is popular with JavaScript developers. It is also free, open-source, and has third-party extensions to add.</p><p>Angular is an open-source, client-side framework for building single-page websites and desktop and mobile applications. It is a full-featured JavaScript application built on TypeScript, which operates across platforms and keeps code clean and consistent throughout the codebase. Angular is an all-in-one rapid application development platform that allows web pages to render efficiently by minimizing communication with servers. The Angular framework offers end-to-end tooling or routing, state management, and form validation, as well as dependency injection and declarative templates. Angular offers out-of-the-box functionality and easy updating, along with an extensive collection of pre-made components. The TypeScript base includes high-quality code that reduces the burden of debugging and allows multiple developers to collaborate across platforms with minimal disruption and less coding.</p><p><strong>Is learning Angular hard?</strong></p><p>Angular is a complex application that contains multiple libraries and cross-platform functionalities, so it can take some time to learn its many features. Angular’s learning curve depends partly on your previous knowledge of web development and your familiarity with the languages used in the Angular platform. If you’re new to Angular, it’s helpful to have some familiarity with the basics of web design and the essentials of HTML and CSS. It’s also useful to know about the other languages that make up the Angular framework. These include basic HTML and CSS, as well as ECMAScript6, or ES6, a general programming language designed to ensure interoperability of web pages across the Internet. It’s also helpful to understand TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript used to write Angular. Learning Angular is even easier if you’re familiar with JavaScript, which is an implementation of ES6 and Angular’s base language.</p><p><strong>What is Angular used for?</strong></p><p>Developers mainly use Angular to build dynamic single-page applications (SPAs) for web, mobile, and desktop. SPAs are web pages based on a single HTML file that is completely controlled by JavaScript. When an action such as clicking a button happens on the page, the code renders it on the page instantly without sending a new request to the server. TypeScript and Angular’s other tools, including routing, state management, and ROM validation, make SPA creation easy and fast. Its open-source JavaScript framework allows developers to reuse code across multiple platforms. Angular’s component-based architecture simplifies the development workflow, making it possible to design apps for deployment in a wide range of environments and update them without extensive recoding.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Angular and React?</strong></p><p>Angular and React are both rapid application development (RAD) platforms based on JavaScript. Angular is a multilayered framework that runs on Typescript and is compatible with many different code editors. It is a full-featured web development platform that requires no additional libraries. This means Angular can independently carry out a full range of development functions such as data binding, form validation, and dependency injection. First introduced in 2013, React is a JavaScript library managed by Facebook, and it works for both single- and multi-page web applications. React is a framework for UI development that’s smaller and faster than Angular. However, it requires other libraries or modules to provide the full range of Angular’s functions. React is easy to install and use for anyone who already knows JavaScript, and because it operates with a virtual DOM, the browser load reduces. Angular operates with a real DOM, which leads to longer runtimes and slower performance.</p><p><strong>Is Angular free to use and where can I get it?</strong></p><p>Angular has both free and paid options, but the developer doesn’t provide pricing information about its paid version for enterprises and large organizations; this information is only available with a custom quote. Individual users can also obtain Angular for free from the developer site. This open-source software is available under an MIT license granted by Google, which gives permission to use the Angular application for any purpose without limitation. New users can also download a free trial version of Angular from the developer. This version is a ready-made standalone app that contains most key features of the platform, and you can install it on any computer without taking all the steps to create the full Angular environment. The free Angular app allows users to get started by learning Angular’s key features and creating a basic app of their own.</p><p><strong>What careers use Angular?</strong></p><p>Angular is one of the most popular web development platforms in use today. Skills in using Angular can be helpful for several careers in fields related to web design and development. Angular skills are most important for careers in practical web development, including specialties like frontend development, which involves designing client-facing web elements such as visual content, UI and UX development, and general software development. Software engineers and site designers can also benefit from learning Angular. It is a JavaScript application, so it’s also useful for JavaScript developers. It’s also possible to create a career around a specialization in Angular development alone. Angular development specialists can work as consultants or independent contractors with multiple organizations needing web development services.</p><p><strong>What IDE is best for Angular?</strong></p><p>An integrated development environment, or IDE, is a software application that consolidates essential web developer tools in a single graphical interface, which streamlines the development process and promotes consistency across all relevant platforms. Many IDEs now support Angular development projects, and there’s an option for every budget. The best paid IDE for Angular is Angular IDE. It was developed especially for the platform, so it supports all its features. Angular IDE is available as a standalone plugin or with an Eclipse plugin. New users can get a 45-day free trial before purchasing. Visual Studio Code is a general-purpose IDE that supports multiple development platforms, including Angular. This free, open-source IDE from Microsoft includes support for TypeScript code and several downloadable Angular plugins.</p><p><strong>What is React?</strong></p><p>React is a front-end library in Javascript that was developed by Facebook. The simplest definition of React is that it is a user interface library used for building UI components for the web. But if that was all React did, it would be little more than a template library. Developers define components in React by using an HTML-like syntax called JSX. These encapsulated components manage their own state, making it simple to pass rich data to a component and keep the state of the application and its components out of the Document Object Model (DOM). These features give React components the ability to react dynamically and efficiently to changes in their state. A set of simple components in React can be composed into either simple single-page applications or large, complex web applications.</p><p><strong>What is React used for?</strong></p><p>React is an open-source JavaScript frontend library. Some developers consider it a frontend framework because it does more than standard libraries usually do. The most common use of React is to build dynamic user interfaces for single-page web applications. But the structure of React makes it useful for more than just creating websites. JSX, which is one feature of React, is a syntax extension for Javascript that provides a template for the HTML and manages the state of the element. But JSX can be used as an interface for things other than HTML. React Native uses React to build mobile applications. Here, JSX becomes an interface for mobile UIs instead of HTML. There are even a few libraries that use React and JSX to interact with and manage hardware like React Hardware.</p><p><strong>How does React work?</strong></p><p>React encourages engineers to write code using a Functional Programming approach. Engineers create components, which are normal Javascript functions. These functions return information to tell React what content should be displayed on the screen. The real power of React comes from the ability to nest or compose these functions inside of one another. This nesting ability encourages code reuse and allows an engineer to write a component a single time, but in many different places.</p><p><strong>Is React a framework or library?</strong></p><p>Frameworks provide an opinionated approach to building an entire application. Libraries, on the other hand, assist in building a single aspect of an application. With this in mind, React is a library. It assists engineers in presenting HTML in the browser. React has no opinions on how data is fetched, how styling is applied, or how the app is deployed or built.</p><p><strong>Is React worth learning?</strong></p><p>Yes, React is worth learning. There are a couple of reasons. The first one is that React is in high demand in the software development job market and has been for a few years. If you learn to code in React and can do it well, you will increase your chances of finding a job. This alone is another reason it is worth learning. Website users no longer will settle for old-fashioned sites that won't update without a page reload. React’s method of dynamically updating the HTML of a web page fits these users' needs and improves their experience. React has also been around a few years and has stood the test of time. A large portion of websites, both small and large, use React as a frontend framework.</p><p><strong>Is React hard to learn?</strong></p><p>Every technology or programming language has a learning curve, and React is no different. But it is easy to learn if you are dedicated and determined to create frontend web applications. To make learning React simpler, you should stick to the basics of React before you add any extra libraries, as that will only complicate your learning experience in the beginning. Since React is a Javascript framework, a solid grounding in Javascript will give you a head start. With this knowledge, the unique concept of JSX, React's templating language, and the way React uses state will be much easier to grasp.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and ReactJS, and which one should I learn?</strong></p><p>React, or React.JS, is a front-end Javascript library for building UI components for the web. If you are interested in web development, React is the perfect library to learn to create interactive, dynamic single-page apps, or even full-scale web applications. React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications for both the Android phone and Apple's iPhone. React Native is still React, which means the syntax and workflow for building applications are basically the same, but the generated components are different. In React, web components are generated. In React Native, the generated components interact with a phone's native APIs. If your focus is web development, then you should learn React. If you want to build mobile applications, it is best to learn React first and become familiar with the technology before you try React Native.</p><p><strong>Why is React so popular?</strong></p><p>There are many reasons why React is popular. One reason is that Facebook developed it. The social proof is that if it is good enough for Facebook, one of the most popular social networks on the web, it should be good enough for other applications. React also solved many of the past issues that developers had with developing single-page applications (SPAs). React came out when SPAs were becoming popular, and all the existing frameworks to build them made development complicated and prone to bugs. One feature that makes it better than past libraries is that React is relatively easy to use. Its components are reusable, plus React's use of the virtual DOM makes it very performant. React should remain popular in the future as each new release brings new features and performance improvements.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why would you want to take this course?</strong></p><p>Our answer is simple: The quality of teaching.</p><p>When you enroll, you will feel our seasoned instructors' expertise.</p><p><strong>Video and Audio Production Quality</strong></p><p>All our videos are created/produced as <strong>high-quality video and audio</strong> to provide you the best learning experience.</p><p>You will be,</p><ul><li><p>Seeing clearly</p></li><li><p>Hearing clearly</p></li><li><p>Moving through the course without distractions</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>You'll also get:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Lifetime Access to The Course</p></li><li><p>Fast &amp; Friendly Support in the Q&amp;A section</p></li><li><p>Udemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download</p></li></ul><p>Dive in now </p><p><strong> Full Stack Web Development with React JS, Angular and NodeJS.</strong></p><p>We offer <strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions.</p><p>See you in the course!</p>|stackoverflow, browsers, programmer, google, html, browser, microsoft, updating, html5, javascript

In this section we cover almost all the <strong>HTML5</strong> concepts and learn how to layout the <strong>structure of HTML elements</strong> on the webpage.</p><p>In the next section we learn the basics of CSS which will help us make our site look appealing. We will learn how we can add CSS to your existing HTML pages to make them more visually attractive. We will also learn about <strong>CSS flex box</strong> which will help us to make responsive layouts.</p><p>Now as we know HTML &amp; CSS, its now time to build something from the skills we have acquired. In this section we will build a <strong>portfolio site </strong>with HTML &amp; CSS which will list all your skills. </p><p>Moving along we now start learning <strong>Bootstrap 4</strong>, a CSS framework which enables us to build <strong>fully mobile responsive websites</strong> in no time. Bootstrap 4 will make your development speed <strong>2X</strong> as faster as you no longer have to build components from scratch. Bootstrap has hundreds of built in components which we can use to build websites quickly and without any hassle. We will learn about the<strong> Bootstrap grid system</strong> and learn how to make responsive layouts with it. </p><p>Once we master Bootstrap 4, its now time to build a <strong>fully mobile responsive news portal</strong>. In this section we will build a news portal which will work and look great on all of the devices like a computer, tablet and a smartphone. The best part about this news portal is that its completely built using Bootstrap and its components. Meaning we have not used a single line of CSS code to style the elements.</p><p>The next section is all about <strong>JavaScript</strong> which is the most popular language for front end web development. We will start off by learning the basics of how JavaScript can be used in the browser to make websites more interactive. We will learn data types, functions, global and local scope, loops, exceptions and all of the other basics related to javaScript. At the end of this section, we also build a <strong>simple interest calculator </strong>using JavaScript and Bootstrap. </p><p>Then we learn about ES6 or <strong>ECMAScript6</strong> which is the latest version of JavaScript. We will learn some of the most relevant and new features of ES6 like the let and the const keywords.</p><p> We then move towards learning <strong>Git &amp; Github</strong> which is one of the most popular tools amongst web developers across the globe. We will start by learning what is Git and how Git can be used for <strong>version control</strong>. We will learn about all the important commands required to work with Git all with a practical example. Later we start learning GitHub and learn how GitHub can be used to <strong>collaborate with teams</strong> while working on a project. </p><p>In the next section we learn about <strong>VueJS</strong> which is a progressive front end framework which helps us to build <strong>user interface components</strong> in an efficient way. VueJs is now being used by a lot of tech companies and is much easier to learn as compared to other similar frameworks like React. Many developers prefer VueJs over React because of its learning curve and the <strong>extensive documentation</strong> available online. In this section we will cover all the important aspects of VueJs.</p><p>Once we finish learning the front end technologies, its now time to start learning about the <strong>backend</strong>. </p><p>We now start learning about <strong>NodeJS</strong> which is a<strong> JavaScript runtime</strong> which allows us to run JavaScript on the server. NodeJS is extremely powerful and it allows us to <strong>configure server</strong>, connect to database, make queries and a lot more can be done using Node. In this section we will start learning Node right from the basics and we will build our very own server. We will also learn about the <strong>node package manager</strong> and learn how it can be used to install and use different node packages which are used to extend the functionality of our apps.</p><p> Now once we know how about Node, we now need a <strong>database</strong> to be able to store and manage our data at the backend. Hence we move on to learn about <strong>Postgres</strong> which is a database used and trusted by large software companies. We will learn about <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> which is a structured query language used to query the Postgres database. We will learn how to create our very own database from scratch and how to setup the structure to store and manage our data.</p><p>In the final section we apply everything we have learned in the entire course by building a fully functional <strong>medical inventory web application.   </strong></p><p>This will be a complex <strong>database oriented</strong> application which will store data into the Postgres database and allow us to insert, update, delete and modify medicine records from the front end. We will learn how to build a complete web app from scratch right from building the database, configuring our server to building the front end. <br></p><p>_________________________________________________________________________</p><p>So let's begin the journey of becoming an <strong>expert Web Developer.</strong></p><p>In addition to the <strong>Udemy</strong> <strong>30-day money back guarantee</strong>,you have my personal guarantee that you will love what you learn in this course.

It started as the programming language for the web and is one of the three layers of standard web technologies — the other two being HTML and CSS. JavaScript allows you to create and control content dynamically on a web page without requiring a page reload. Web browsers are able to interpret it, and when triggered by events, modify the HTML and CSS of a web page with dynamic updates. JavaScript also uses asynchronous calls to fetch data from web services in the background. Although it was initially only used in web browsers, JavaScript engines have since been put to use as servers with Node.js, included in desktop application frameworks like Electron, and embedded in phone frameworks like Apache Cordova.</p><p><strong>Why is JavaScript important?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is the programming language that allows users to interact with the websites that they're visiting, making it a very important language for web developers to know. In the past, most developers focused on the backend; JavaScript was only relevant when they needed to use visual effects. As web development evolved and the focus shifted towards user experience, programmers started to rely on JavaScript for their frontend code heavily. Today, most sites use JavaScript to fetch and submit data, use logic, and generate HTML in browsers. JavaScript can also communicate asynchronously with data servers in the background without interrupting the user interaction in the foreground. These features make JavaScript not only an important language but a necessary language for modern web development.</p><p><strong>What are the main uses of JavaScript?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is a text-based programming language used for client- and server-side development. Web developers have used JavaScript since its inception to add simple interactivity to web pages like modals, animated elements, or image slideshows. While that is still one of its primary uses, Javascript has evolved to building complete web applications. SPAs, or single page applications, depend on JavaScript-based frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue to bring a desktop-like application experience to the browser. However, it's important to note that web browsers aren't places that make good use of the programming language. Javascript is also popular for building web services and back-end infrastructure with Node.js. React Native, Xamarin, Ionic, and NativeScript frameworks use JavaScript for developing phone apps as well.</p><p><strong>React vs. Angular vs. Vue: what is the best JavaScript framework?</strong></p><p>Choosing the best JavaScript framework for your web project depends on what you are looking for. React is a popular framework, which means you will find a lot of community support if you need help. It is also considered relatively easy to learn but is being developed at a rapid pace. Angular is a framework that makes data binding easy so that you can template an application faster. It also uses the RxJS library to simplify asynchronous programming and Typescript (which compiles to JavaScript) for a cleaner, less error-prone development process. Some cons of Angular are that it can have a steep learning curve and can be complex. Vue is a lightweight framework, so it is easy to learn, very performant, and flexible. Some cons of Vue are limited plugins, and its flexibility can lead to irregular code.</p><p><strong>What is Node.Js and what is it used for?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is a server environment built for fast and easily scalable network applications. It was built on Chrome’s JavaScript runtime and uses an event-driven, non-blocking model that makes it the best fit for applications that run on distributed devices and need to run in real-time. By using JavaScript, node.Js can be put to work by many software developers familiar with JavaScript. Because the code is open-source, you can also use it on any platform (Mac OS, Windows, or Linux). Node.js is the architecture for creating websites and real-time applications because it’s easy for teams to learn, and it’s fast. Examples of applications that use node.Js include video conferencing apps, chat servers, eCommerce software, and collaborative online gaming.</p><p><strong>What are the advantages of Node.Js?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is open-source, meaning it’s a free code for all developers. On top of that, it also means that there is a thriving community of Node.Js users and programmers that all add to the knowledge base. Many are happy to share their flavor of the code with other developers, and collectively, the Node.Js environment continues to be enhanced. Because Node.Js uses JavaScript, there is a large pool of developers that understand and can code in the environment. It’s also a relatively simple environment for new team members to learn, making it an efficient choice for development teams with people that need training. Node.Js was developed on Push technology instead of web sockets, which is why it’s the preferred choice for real-time communication applications and programs that need to be highly scalable.</p><p><strong>What does it mean that Node.Js is a runtime system?</strong></p><p>A runtime system is a platform where a software program runs. It’s essentially an environment housing the collection of software and hardware that allows an application to execute (or run). Node.Js is a runtime system because it provides the environment necessary for applications to run within it, and no additional code or hardware is required. Because Node.Js makes use of JavaScript, it’s a runtime system that provides a framework where you can use JavaScript to create and run programs. The JavaScript programming language (which is quite popular) is then automatically translated into machine code for the hardware to run the program in real-time. It’s an efficient system, making it the preferred choice for many software and tech companies.</p><p><strong>What is microservices architecture and how can Node.Js be used for it?</strong></p><p>Microservices architecture is a software development style or method where single-function modules originate. Each has a very well-defined operation and interface and can deploy on its own. In essence, it’s a way of developing modules that you can repurpose from one program or application to another. When you create an application, it’s a collection of modules that have been thoroughly tested and are well-maintained. The modules are typically built around different business-specific capabilities and are then loosely coupled to other modules when deployed as part of a program. You can use Node.Js in microservices architecture as the language of choice for one, some, or all of the microservices (or modules). The beauty of microservices is that you can use the best language for the specific microservice. But where highly scalable, fast programs are needed, Node.Js would be a top contender.</p><p><strong>Video and Audio Production Quality</strong></p><p>All our videos are created/produced as <strong>high-quality video and audio</strong> to provide you the best learning experience. </p><p>You will be,</p><ul><li><p>Seeing clearly</p></li><li><p>Hearing clearly</p></li><li><p>Moving through the course without distractions</p></li></ul><p><strong> You'll also get:</strong></p><p>Lifetime Access to The Course</p><p>Fast &amp; Friendly Support in the Q&amp;A section</p><p>Udemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download</p><p>Dive in now to our&nbsp;<strong>Javascript, Nodejs, MongoDB for Full Stack Web Development </strong>course</p><p>We offer&nbsp;<strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions.</p><p>See you in the course!</p>|developers, web, plugins, programmers, browsers, internet, browser, apps, html, javascript

The simplest definition of React is that it is a user interface library used for building UI components for the web. But if that was all React did, it would be little more than a template library. Developers define components in React by using an HTML-like syntax called JSX. These encapsulated components manage their own state, making it simple to pass rich data to a component and keep the state of the application and its components out of the Document Object Model (DOM). These features give React components the ability to react dynamically and efficiently to changes in their state. A set of simple components in React can be composed into either simple single-page applications or large, complex web applications.</p><p><strong>What is React used for?</strong></p><p>React is an open-source JavaScript frontend library. Some developers consider it a frontend framework because it does more than standard libraries usually do. The most common use of React is to build dynamic user interfaces for single-page web applications. But the structure of React makes it useful for more than just creating websites. JSX, which is one feature of React, is a syntax extension for Javascript that provides a template for the HTML and manages the state of the element. But JSX can be used as an interface for things other than HTML. React Native uses React to build mobile applications. Here, JSX becomes an interface for mobile UIs instead of HTML. There are even a few libraries that use React and JSX to interact with and manage hardware like React Hardware.</p><p><strong>How does React work?</strong></p><p>React encourages engineers to write code using a Functional Programming approach. Engineers create components, which are normal Javascript functions. These functions return information to tell React what content should be displayed on the screen. The real power of React comes from the ability to nest or compose these functions inside of one another. This nesting ability encourages code reuse and allows an engineer to write a component a single time, but in many different places.</p><p><strong>Is React a framework or library?</strong></p><p>Frameworks provide an opinionated approach to building an entire application. Libraries, on the other hand, assist in building a single aspect of an application. With this in mind, React is a library. It assists engineers in presenting HTML in the browser. React has no opinions on how data is fetched, how styling is applied, or how the app is deployed or built.</p><p><strong>What is React Native?</strong></p><p>Created by Facebook, React Native is an open-source-based mobile application framework that uses only JavaScript, making it capable of supporting both Android and iOS platforms. React, also known as React.js, saves time and effort for developers since they only need one programming language. The Native element allows developers to create JavaScript components to design software programs that run on various devices and platforms, such as smartphones, smart TVs, and laptops. With React Native, developers use the same concepts used in the original React framework to design a rich mobile user interface (UI) for various environments from existing components.</p><p><strong>Is React worth learning?</strong></p><p>Yes, React is worth learning. There are a couple of reasons. The first one is that React is in high demand in the software development job market and has been for a few years. If you learn to code in React and can do it well, you will increase your chances of finding a job. This alone is another reason it is worth learning. Website users no longer will settle for old-fashioned sites that won't update without a page reload. React’s method of dynamically updating the HTML of a web page fits these users' needs and improves their experience. React has also been around a few years and has stood the test of time. A large portion of websites, both small and large, use React as a frontend framework.</p><p><strong>Is React hard to learn?</strong></p><p>Every technology or programming language has a learning curve, and React is no different. But it is easy to learn if you are dedicated and determined to create frontend web applications. To make learning React simpler, you should stick to the basics of React before you add any extra libraries, as that will only complicate your learning experience in the beginning. Since React is a Javascript framework, a solid grounding in Javascript will give you a head start. With this knowledge, the unique concept of JSX, React's templating language, and the way React uses state will be much easier to grasp.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and ReactJS, and which one should I learn?</strong></p><p>React, or React.JS, is a front-end Javascript library for building UI components for the web. If you are interested in web development, React is the perfect library to learn to create interactive, dynamic single-page apps, or even full-scale web applications. React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications for both the Android phone and Apple's iPhone. React Native is still React, which means the syntax and workflow for building applications are basically the same, but the generated components are different. In React, web components are generated. In React Native, the generated components interact with a phone's native APIs. If your focus is web development, then you should learn React. If you want to build mobile applications, it is best to learn React first and become familiar with the technology before you try React Native.</p><p><strong>Why is React so popular?</strong></p><p>There are many reasons why React is popular. One reason is that Facebook developed it. The social proof is that if it is good enough for Facebook, one of the most popular social networks on the web, it should be good enough for other applications. React also solved many of the past issues that developers had with developing single-page applications (SPAs). React came out when SPAs were becoming popular, and all the existing frameworks to build them made development complicated and prone to bugs. One feature that makes it better than past libraries is that React is relatively easy to use. Its components are reusable, plus React's use of the virtual DOM makes it very performant. React should remain popular in the future as each new release brings new features and performance improvements.</p><p><strong>What is Node.Js and what is it used for?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is a server environment built for fast and easily scalable network applications. It was built on Chrome’s JavaScript runtime and uses an event-driven, non-blocking model that makes it the best fit for applications that run on distributed devices and need to run in real-time.

It’s also a relatively simple environment for new team members to learn, making it an efficient choice for development teams with people that need training. Node.Js was developed on Push technology instead of web sockets, which is why it’s the preferred choice for real-time communication applications and programs that need to be highly scalable.</p><p><strong>What does it mean that Node.Js is a runtime system?</strong></p><p>A runtime system is a platform where a software program runs.

1657930|GraphQL by Example|729|/course/graphql-by-example/|fullstack|0|4.7|en|Mirko Nasato|<p>More and more teams are choosing <strong>GraphQL</strong> instead of (or along with)&nbsp;REST&nbsp;for their web&nbsp;APIs. GraphQL queries give clients great flexibility in the way they request data from the server, preventing issues such&nbsp;<em>overfetching</em> or <em>underfetching</em> of data, and allowing&nbsp;multiple resources to be retrieved in a single request.</p><p>In this course you'll learn how to use GraphQL both on the server side and in client applications through practical examples in the form of full-stack JavaScript applications. You will be introduced to all the main GraphQL concepts like <em>schema definition</em>, <em>Queries</em>, <em>Mutations</em>, and <em>Subscriptions</em>, as well as to solution to common requirements such as handling authentication/authorization and client-side caching.</p><p>The examples use <strong>Apollo Server</strong> with <em>Node.js</em> and <em>Express</em> on the backend and React on the frontend, with <em>GraphQL-Request</em> first, then <strong>Apollo Client</strong> as GraphQL clients. <em>GraphQL-WS</em> is used for subscriptions.</p><p>The aim however is not just to cover specific GraphQL libraries, but to give you a more general understanding of the underlying concepts. For instance, GraphQL client libraries are introduced only after learning how to write a simple client by hand, to make sure you understand the GraphQL over HTTP format.</p><p>This course assumes good knowledge of modern JavaScript, and ideally some familiarity with Node.js/Express and React.</p>|libraries, clients, applications, http, client, authentication, graphql, javascript, web, server

In other words, web pages are composed of HTML, which is used to display text, images, or other resources through a web browser.</p><p>HTML is the basic building block of the web and actually isn’t a technical programming language. It is responsible for the structure of the website. </p><p><strong>Django</strong> is an interesting framework for developers because it provides the infrastructure required for database-driven websites that have user authentication, content administration, contact forms and more. Instead of creating all of these features from scratch, you can use the Django framework that is already built so you can focus your time on developing your web app instead.</p><p>In this course, we will start with HTML, which is the basis of web development and then we will continue to learn CSS.</p><p>This course will take you<strong> from a beginner to a more experienced level. </strong>You will learn <strong>HTML5 and CSS3</strong> step by step with <strong>hands-on</strong> examples.</p><p><strong>In this course you will learn;</strong></p><ul><li><p>To create static HTML sites,</p></li><li><p>To create a beautiful, responsive landing page for anyone,</p></li><li><p>You will learn to use basic tags which are used commonly,</p></li><li><p>You will be able to prepare lists in different formats,</p></li><li><p>The difference in usage between block-level and inline elements in HTML,</p></li><li><p>The uses of HTML table, and by learning this you will be able to create different designs of your own,</p></li><li><p>To able to create commonly used user login and registration pages by learning the form structure,</p></li><li><p>And improve your knowledge step by step by learning the basics of CSS</p></li><li><p>To place pages in the easiest way by talking about all layout models in CSS.</p></li><li><p>To prepare web pages with Grid CSS and Flexbox features.</p></li><li><p>Learn modeling your domain and code classes with Django</p></li><li><p>Basic Commands for Mac</p></li><li><p>Understand Django basics like Models, HTTP, Processes</p></li><li><p>Learn how to do Django Migrations with codes</p></li></ul><p><strong>What is web development?</strong></p><p>Web development is a broad description of the tasks and technologies that go into creating a website. It can be as simple as making a static text-based website or as elaborate as developing an interactive dynamic website. You can break web development into two different categories: frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side). Frontend code executes on the user's computer. This can include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Backend code runs on the server — this commonly includes communicating with a database and often involves languages like Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP. Web development does not necessarily include the design process — it focuses on code. A web designer builds wireframes to mockup their vision for a website and then shares that with a developer. The developer is responsible for writing the code that implements the design.</p><p><strong>What are the steps to becoming a web developer?</strong></p><p>Some web developers will obtain a degree or certification in the field. However, most jobs don't require a specific degree or level of education, just demonstrated knowledge of the field. So, it is more important that you know how to show off your skills. You could highlight your skills through relevant work experience or a portfolio of past projects. You might also share code you have developed using a platform like GitHub, or participate in solution-based forums like StackOverflow that reward you for helping others. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the first three coding languages you'll need to learn to break into web development. You need these three essential elements to create a modern website and work as a frontend web developer. HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) specifies the content of the website and builds the backbone. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles the content. JavaScript controls the interactive elements of the website.</p><p><strong>How long does it take to become a web developer?</strong></p><p>The answer to this question will depend on you. The more time you spend developing your skills, the faster you can become a web developer. The good news is that web development generally uses light-weight code that is easier to learn than many other languages. If dedicated, you can learn the basics of web development in a couple of months. But good web developers never stop learning. A better question might be, What can I do to become a better web developer faster? The answer to this question is practice. Becoming familiar with coding helps tremendously, but there is also a less obvious benefit of practicing. The more you code, the more you will run into problems or find bugs in your code. A significant aspect of web development is solving problems and debugging code. The better you get at solving problems and tracking down bugs, the faster you will get at coding.</p><p><strong>What are the most popular coding languages for web development?</strong></p><p>The must-know languages for frontend web development are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These languages are used by nearly every site you visit. JavaScript is a fundamental programming language for adding interactivity to your website. There are many popular JavaScript libraries that you can import and allow you to add useful functionality while dramatically decreasing the amount of code you might write, and offering features that would be difficult or time-consuming to code yourself. Once you are comfortable with JavaScript, you will want to explore the many libraries available. There are many other programming languages that you can use for web development. If you want to write backend code, you will need to learn a language that runs on the server that powers your website (as opposed to the web browser, where frontend code is executed). Consider learning Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP. It can be helpful to research which backend language is popular in the field that interests you most.</p><p><strong>What are the skills I need to become a web developer?</strong></p><p>You'll need to be able to code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Mastering these three languages is essential for web development. They each serve a crucial function: HTML is the content itself – the words, pictures, etc., CSS controls how all of that content looks, and JavaScript makes a website interactive. Luckily, you can learn all three languages on your own using online tools and courses. To be a good web developer, you'll also need many skills beyond programming languages. A crucial professional skill is problem-solving. Good problem-solving skills will help you to track down bugs quickly and develop algorithms to complete complex tasks. Interpersonal skills are also necessary for the job, such as communication and collaboration. Many web development projects require a team of developers. To succeed in web development, you must work well in team environments.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between front-end, back-end, and full-stack web development?</strong></p><p>Frontend web developers write client-side code. This is all the code that runs on the user's computer when they visit a website. Generally, this includes everything that the user can see. To write frontend code, you need to know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Backend web developers write server-side code. This is all the code that runs on the website's server. Backend code controls the logic of the website. For example, a frontend developer may code where a username will appear on a website and its style, but the backend developer will write the code that retrieves the username from the database. Backend developers need to know a server-side programming language in addition to HTML and JavaScript. Not all projects have a front and backend web developer. Some projects only have full-stack web developers, which do both front and backend coding. The team composition depends on the needs of the project. Full-stack web developers need to be strong front and backend coders.</p><p><strong>What is Python?</strong></p><p>Python is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks.</p><p><strong>Python vs. R: what is the Difference?</strong></p><p>Python and R are two of today's most popular programming tools. When deciding between Python and R, you need to think about your specific needs. On one hand, Python is relatively easy for beginners to learn, is applicable across many disciplines, has a strict syntax that will help you become a better coder, and is fast to process large datasets. On the other hand, R has over 10,000 packages for data manipulation, is capable of easily making publication-quality graphics, boasts superior capability for statistical modeling, and is more widely used in academia, healthcare, and finance.</p><p><strong>What does it mean that Python is object-oriented?</strong></p><p>Python is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports many programming approaches. Along with procedural and functional programming styles, Python also supports the object-oriented style of programming. In object-oriented programming, a developer completes a programming project by creating Python objects in code that represent objects in the actual world. These objects can contain both the data and functionality of the real-world object. To generate an object in Python you need a class. You can think of a class as a template. You create the template once, and then use the template to create as many objects as you need. Python classes have attributes to represent data and methods that add functionality. A class representing a car may have attributes like color, speed, and seats and methods like driving, steering, and stopping. The concept of combining data with functionality in an object is called encapsulation, a core concept in the object-oriented programming paradigm.</p><p><strong>What are the limitations of Python?</strong></p><p>Python is a widely used, general-purpose programming language, but it has some limitations. Because Python is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, it is slow compared to a compiled, statically typed language like C. Therefore, Python is useful when speed is not that important. Python's dynamic type system also makes it use more memory than some other programming languages, so it is not suited to memory-intensive applications. The Python virtual engine that runs Python code runs single-threaded, making concurrency another limitation of the programming language. Though Python is popular for some types of game development, its higher memory and CPU usage limits its usage for high-quality 3D game development. That being said, computer hardware is getting better and better, and the speed and memory limitations of Python are getting less and less relevant making Python even more popular.</p><p><strong>How is Python used?</strong></p><p>Python is a general programming language used widely across many industries and platforms. One common use of Python is scripting, which means automating tasks in the background. Many of the scripts that ship with Linux operating systems are Python scripts. Python is also a popular language for machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, and data science because its simple syntax makes it easy to quickly build real applications. You can use Python to create desktop applications. Many developers use it to write Linux desktop applications, and it is also an excellent choice for web and game development. Python web frameworks like Flask and Django are a popular choice for developing web applications. Recently, Python is also being used as a language for mobile development via the Kivy third-party library, although there are currently some drawbacks Python needs to overcome when it comes to mobile development.</p><p><strong>What is Django?</strong></p><p>Django is a Python-based Web Application Framework that follows the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern. As one of the most popular Web Application Frameworks available today, Django has an extensive amount of documentation and extensions available. It is also built primarily for data-driven websites. A non-profit organization and an active community of developers contribute to Django’s platform, which is both open-source and free. The advantages of using Django are rapid development and less code. Django also provides an administrative interface and many bundled components. Websites such as The Washington Times, Instagram, and Nextdoor used Django for development, and employers frequently seek Django developers and Python specialists for web development.</p><p><strong>Who uses Django?</strong></p><p>Python programmers who are interested in a low code development prefer Django for its “don’t repeat yourself” model. Ideally, Django can create streamlined programs that require little coding to initialize. It has a significant body of architecture within its components and libraries, and you can administer it internally. Developers primarily use Django for web applications that need to balance large amounts of data and significant loads. Over 2,500 packages are available to extend Django’s behavior, making it a particularly robust platform. Developers interested in using Django can check to see if the functionality they desire already exists. Django is also often favored by full-stack developers who want to be able to build web applications from start to finish, as you can use it for both frontend and backend design.</p><p><strong>Is Django frontend or backend?</strong></p><p>Frontend design is related to what the user sees and interacts with. Backend is concerned primarily with the data. Django is both a frontend and backend Web Application Framework, unlike platforms like JavaScript’s Bootstrap, which you can use for frontend design. Django concerns itself primarily with the application’s interior workings, such as data manipulation, but is also useful for end-to-end frontend and backend design. A developer familiar with Django may be able to develop their web application “full-stack,” developing the entirety of the web application from front to back. However, frontend and backend work in Django can be separated if desired, meaning you can use Django for one or the other with some work. When separated in this way, Django is compatible with other frontend or backend technology.</p><p><strong>What are the key considerations when deciding on a Web Application Framework?</strong></p><p>There are both open-source, free Web Application Frameworks and commercial, proprietary frameworks. The latter is more expensive, but it will generally come with more support. Web Application Frameworks usually focus on a specific language. Django works with Python. Additionally, every Web Application Framework has its own level of complexity and learning curve, documentation, and support. Most web developers will want a Web Application Framework in a language they are fluent in. A solid library of extensions and plug-ins is also ideal as it reduces the amount of work the developer will need to do. Since the Web Application Framework has a lot to do with how a system functions, the system's look-and-feel may also come into play, as may other quality of life issues such as the robustness of the administrative panel.</p><p><strong>What is the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern?</strong></p><p>The Model-View-Controller architectural pattern (MVC) is a type of software pattern for creating user interfaces. It standardizes how information flows through an application and makes it easier for developers to control all levels, from frontend to backend. Many Web Application Frameworks today follow the MVC model. Under the MVC architecture, the “model” refers to the data. The “view” refers to the display. Finally, the “controller” refers to the way that both models and views are updated. By retaining this consistency, multiple developers can also work together (both frontend and backend) without potentially retreading ground or overwriting essential items. The MVC model makes it easier to manage interconnected elements while ensuring that the application functions as a whole. MVC is compatible with desktop, mobile, and web application designs.</p><p><strong>What is HTML and why is it important?</strong></p><p>HTML stands for hyper-text markup language. Whether on a mobile device or a computer, every website that you browse is designed with HTML. HTML isn’t a “programming language,” but rather a “formatting language.” It tells a browser how to display text, images, and other media elements. When HTML was first developed, it was fairly simple. For example, the text on a page could be bolded, italicized, or underlined, and images could be resized and aligned. Today, HTML is much more complex and dynamic, allowing front-end developers to create any layout or setup they desire.</p><p><strong>Why is CSS and Javascript important for HTML?</strong></p><p>HTML is a formatting language, not a programming language. Javascript is often necessary to make HTML “dynamic.” While HTML can make it so that text is displayed on the screen, Javascript can update this text or make it move. Javascript is used for both front-end and back-end development, hand-in-hand with HTML, to create complex and attractive web designs. Meanwhile, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are used to organize the look and feel of a website and make the website easier to update and manipulate. Today, HTML, CSS, and Javascript are frequently used to develop responsive web designs — designs that react to a user’s environment for a better user experience.</p><p><strong>What is an HTML element and why is it important?</strong></p><p>HTML is designed on a modular basis, meaning every part of the web page has a specific “place.” An HTML element is a part of the page. Common HTML elements include “&lt;p&gt;” for a “paragraph” and “&lt;title&gt;” for the “title” of the page. In fact, the entirety of the HTML page is within the “&lt;html&gt;” element. Elements are begun and ended with tags, so a title would be written: “&lt;title&gt;This is the Title to the page.&lt;/title&gt;” Organizing code this way makes it easier to reference and control. Each element may also have characteristics. For instance, the “&lt;p&gt;” (paragraph) tag can be aligned in a certain direction. These are the basic building blocks of HTML and what most designers should learn first.</p><p><strong>What is Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)?</strong></p><p>CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used to style markup language. Markup languages include HTML, XHML, XML, and other XML-based languages. The most common use of CSS is to style HTML web pages. Although HTML doesn't need CSS to function, every web page would look the same without it. With CSS, you can target specific elements in a web page and change the look and arrangement on the page. CSS can make an embedded image small or cover the entire webpage as a background. You can enlarge a heading and apply a specific font to stand out from the rest of the page. Other things you can do with CSS include changing the color of elements, making elements float to one side of the page, and the list goes on. Every web page uses HTML, and every web page that has its unique look uses CSS.</p><p><strong>What careers use CSS?</strong></p><p>CSS applies to any career that involves web development. Web designers create the templates, mockups, and styles for a website using HTML and CSS that web developers use to build websites. Front-end web developers use CSS with HTML and JavaScript to build front-end web applications that run in the browser. Fullstack web developers create both the part of a web application that runs in the browser and on the server and need to know CSS to make the front-end look good. Content managers may need to know CSS to apply custom styles to articles they publish through a content management system like WordPress. Other job titles that may require you to know CSS include junior web developer, social media manager, website editor, content editor, website project manager, website support specialist, and webmaster.</p><p><strong>Why would you want to take this course?</strong>&nbsp; </p><p>Our answer is simple: The quality of teaching. </p><p>When you enroll, you will feel the OAK Academy`s seasoned instructors' expertise.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>Video and Audio Production Quality</strong></p><p>All our videos are created/produced as <strong>high-quality video and audio</strong> to provide you the best learning experience. </p><p>You will be,</p><ul><li><p>Seeing clearly</p></li><li><p>Hearing clearly</p></li><li><p>Moving through the course without distractions</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong> You'll also get:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Lifetime Access to The Course</p></li><li><p>Fast &amp; Friendly Support in the Q&amp;A section</p></li><li><p>Udemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download</p></li></ul><p>Dive in now <strong>HTML, CSS &amp; Python Django for the Full Stack Web Development </strong>course.</p><p>We offer&nbsp;<strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions.</p><p>See you in the course!</p>|stackoverflow, browser, java, php, html, webmaster, html5, django, javascript, python

The simplest definition of React is that it is a user interface library used for building UI components for the web. But if that was all React did, it would be little more than a template library. Developers define components in React by using an HTML-like syntax called JSX. These encapsulated components manage their own state, making it simple to pass rich data to a component and keep the state of the application and its components out of the Document Object Model (DOM). These features give React components the ability to react dynamically and efficiently to changes in their state. A set of simple components in React can be composed into either simple single-page applications or large, complex web applications.</p><p><strong>What is React used for?</strong></p><p>React is an open-source JavaScript frontend library. Some developers consider it a frontend framework because it does more than standard libraries usually do. The most common use of React is to build dynamic user interfaces for single-page web applications. But the structure of React makes it useful for more than just creating websites. JSX, which is one feature of React, is a syntax extension for Javascript that provides a template for the HTML and manages the state of the element. But JSX can be used as an interface for things other than HTML. React Native uses React to build mobile applications. Here, JSX becomes an interface for mobile UIs instead of HTML. There are even a few libraries that use React and JSX to interact with and manage hardware like React Hardware.</p><p><strong>How does React work?</strong></p><p>React encourages engineers to write code using a Functional Programming approach. Engineers create components, which are normal Javascript functions. These functions return information to tell React what content should be displayed on the screen. The real power of React comes from the ability to nest or compose these functions inside of one another. This nesting ability encourages code reuse and allows an engineer to write a component a single time, but in many different places.</p><p><strong>Is React a framework or library?</strong></p><p>Frameworks provide an opinionated approach to building an entire application. Libraries, on the other hand, assist in building a single aspect of an application. With this in mind, React is a library. It assists engineers in presenting HTML in the browser. React has no opinions on how data is fetched, how styling is applied, or how the app is deployed or built.</p><p><strong>Is React worth learning?</strong></p><p>Yes, React is worth learning. There are a couple of reasons. The first one is that React is in high demand in the software development job market and has been for a few years. If you learn to code in React and can do it well, you will increase your chances of finding a job. This alone is another reason it is worth learning. Website users no longer will settle for old-fashioned sites that won't update without a page reload. React’s method of dynamically updating the HTML of a web page fits these users' needs and improves their experience. React has also been around a few years and has stood the test of time. A large portion of websites, both small and large, use React as a frontend framework.</p><p><strong>Is React hard to learn?</strong></p><p>Every technology or programming language has a learning curve, and React is no different. But it is easy to learn if you are dedicated and determined to create frontend web applications. To make learning React simpler, you should stick to the basics of React before you add any extra libraries, as that will only complicate your learning experience in the beginning. Since React is a Javascript framework, a solid grounding in Javascript will give you a head start. With this knowledge, the unique concept of JSX, React's templating language, and the way React uses state will be much easier to grasp.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and ReactJS, and which one should I learn?</strong></p><p>React, or React JS, is a front-end Javascript library for building UI components for the web. If you are interested in web development, React is the perfect library to learn to create interactive, dynamic single-page apps, or even full-scale web applications. React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications for both the Android phone and Apple's iPhone. React Native is still React, which means the syntax and workflow for building applications are basically the same, but the generated components are different. In React, web components are generated. In React Native, the generated components interact with a phone's native APIs. If your focus is web development, then you should learn React. If you want to build mobile applications, it is best to learn React first and become familiar with the technology before you try React Native.</p><p><strong>Why is React so popular?</strong></p><p>There are many reasons why React is popular. One reason is that Facebook developed it. The social proof is that if it is good enough for Facebook, one of the most popular social networks on the web, it should be good enough for other applications. React also solved many of the past issues that developers had with developing single-page applications (SPAs). React came out when SPAs were becoming popular, and all the existing frameworks to build them made development complicated and prone to bugs. One feature that makes it better than past libraries is that React is relatively easy to use. Its components are reusable, plus React's use of the virtual DOM makes it very performant. React should remain popular in the future as each new release brings new features and performance improvements.</p><p><strong>What is Node.Js and what is it used for?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is a server environment built for fast and easily scalable network applications. It was built on Chrome’s JavaScript runtime and uses an event-driven, non-blocking model that makes it the best fit for applications that run on distributed devices and need to run in real-time. By using JavaScript, node.Js can be put to work by many software developers familiar with JavaScript. Because the code is open-source, you can also use it on any platform (Mac OS, Windows, or Linux). Node.js is the architecture for creating websites and real-time applications because it’s easy for teams to learn, and it’s fast. Examples of applications that use node.Js include video conferencing apps, chat servers, eCommerce software, and collaborative online gaming.</p><p><strong>What are the advantages of Node.Js?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is open-source, meaning it’s free code for all developers. On top of that, it also means that there is a thriving community of Node.Js users and programmers that all add to the knowledge base. Many are happy to share their flavor of the code with other developers, and collectively, the Node.Js environment continues to be enhanced. Because Node.Js uses JavaScript, there is a large pool of developers that understand and can code in the environment. It’s also a relatively simple environment for new team members to learn, making it an efficient choice for development teams with people that need training. Node.Js was developed on Push technology instead of web sockets, which is why it’s the preferred choice for real-time communication applications and programs that need to be highly scalable.</p><p><strong>What does it mean that Node.Js is a runtime system?</strong></p><p>A runtime system is a platform where a software program runs. It’s essentially an environment housing the collection of software and hardware that allows an application to execute (or run). Node.Js is a runtime system because it provides the environment necessary for applications to run within it, and no additional code or hardware is required. Because Node.Js makes use of JavaScript, it’s a runtime system that provides a framework where you can use JavaScript to create and run programs. The JavaScript programming language (which is quite popular) is then automatically translated into machine code for the hardware to run the program in real-time. It’s an efficient system, making it the preferred choice for many software and tech companies.</p><p><strong><em>Fresh Content</em></strong></p><p>It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate. New tools are released every day, and it’s crucial to stay on top of the latest knowledge for being a better React developer.

It can be as simple as making a static text-based website or as elaborate as developing an interactive dynamic website. You can break web development into two different categories: frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side). Frontend code executes on the user's computer. This can include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Backend code runs on the server — this commonly includes communicating with a database and often involves languages like Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP. Web development does not necessarily include the design process — it focuses on code. A web designer builds wireframes to mockup their vision for a website and then shares that with a developer. The developer is responsible for writing the code that implements the design.</p><p><strong>What are the steps to becoming a web developer?</strong></p><p>Some web developers will obtain a degree or certification in the field. However, most jobs don't require a specific degree or level of education, just demonstrated knowledge of the field. So, it is more important that you know how to show off your skills. You could highlight your skills through relevant work experience or a portfolio of past projects. You might also share code you have developed using a platform like GitHub, or participate in solution-based forums like StackOverflow that reward you for helping others. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the first three coding languages you'll need to learn to break into web development. You need these three essential elements to create a modern website and work as a frontend web developer. HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) specifies the content of the website and builds the backbone. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles the content. JavaScript controls the interactive elements of the website.</p><p><strong>How long does it take to become a web developer?</strong></p><p>The answer to this question will depend on you. The more time you spend developing your skills, the faster you can become a web developer. The good news is that web development generally uses light-weight code that is easier to learn than many other languages. If dedicated, you can learn the basics of web development in a couple of months. But good web developers never stop learning. A better question might be, What can I do to become a better web developer faster? The answer to this question is practice. Becoming familiar with coding helps tremendously, but there is also a less obvious benefit of practicing. The more you code, the more you will run into problems or find bugs in your code. A significant aspect of web development is solving problems and debugging code. The better you get at solving problems and tracking down bugs, the faster you will get at coding.</p><p><strong>What is React?</strong></p><p>React is a front-end library in Javascript that was developed by Facebook. The simplest definition of React is that it is a user interface library used for building UI components for the web. But if that was all React did, it would be little more than a template library. Developers define components in React by using an HTML-like syntax called JSX. These encapsulated components manage their own state, making it simple to pass rich data to a component and keep the state of the application and its components out of the Document Object Model (DOM). These features give React components the ability to react dynamically and efficiently to changes in their state. A set of simple components in React can be composed into either simple single-page applications or large, complex web applications.</p><p><strong>What is React used for?</strong></p><p>React is an open-source JavaScript frontend library. Some developers consider it a frontend framework because it does more than standard libraries usually do. The most common use of React is to build dynamic user interfaces for single-page web applications. But the structure of React makes it useful for more than just creating websites. JSX, which is one feature of React, is a syntax extension for Javascript that provides a template for the HTML and manages the state of the element. But JSX can be used as an interface for things other than HTML. React Native uses React to build mobile applications. Here, JSX becomes an interface for mobile UIs instead of HTML. There are even a few libraries that use React and JSX to interact with and manage hardware like React Hardware.</p><p><strong>How does React work?</strong></p><p>React encourages engineers to write code using a Functional Programming approach. Engineers create components, which are normal Javascript functions. These functions return information to tell React what content should be displayed on the screen. The real power of React comes from the ability to nest or compose these functions inside of one another. This nesting ability encourages code reuse and allows an engineer to write a component a single time, but in many different places.</p><p><strong>Is React a framework or library?</strong></p><p>Frameworks provide an opinionated approach to building an entire application. Libraries, on the other hand, assist in building a single aspect of an application. With this in mind, React is a library. It assists engineers in presenting HTML in the browser. React has no opinions on how data is fetched, how styling is applied, or how the app is deployed or built.</p><p><strong>Is React worth learning?</strong></p><p>Yes, React is worth learning. There are a couple of reasons. The first one is that React is in high demand in the software development job market and has been for a few years. If you learn to code in React and can do it well, you will increase your chances of finding a job. This alone is another reason it is worth learning. Website users no longer will settle for old-fashioned sites that won't update without a page reload. React’s method of dynamically updating the HTML of a web page fits these users' needs and improves their experience. React has also been around a few years and has stood the test of time. A large portion of websites, both small and large, use React as a frontend framework.</p><p><strong>Is React hard to learn?</strong></p><p>Every technology or programming language has a learning curve, and React is no different. But it is easy to learn if you are dedicated and determined to create frontend web applications. To make learning React simpler, you should stick to the basics of React before you add any extra libraries, as that will only complicate your learning experience in the beginning. Since React is a Javascript framework, a solid grounding in Javascript will give you a head start. With this knowledge, the unique concept of JSX, React's templating language, and the way React uses state will be much easier to grasp.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and ReactJS, and which one should I learn?</strong></p><p>React, or React.JS, is a front-end Javascript library for building UI components for the web. If you are interested in web development, React is the perfect library to learn to create interactive, dynamic single-page apps, or even full-scale web applications. React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications for both the Android phone and Apple's iPhone. React Native is still React, which means the syntax and workflow for building applications are basically the same, but the generated components are different. In React, web components are generated. In React Native, the generated components interact with a phone's native APIs. If your focus is web development, then you should learn React. If you want to build mobile applications, it is best to learn React first and become familiar with the technology before you try React Native.</p><p><strong>Why is React so popular?</strong></p><p>There are many reasons why React is popular. One reason is that Facebook developed it. The social proof is that if it is good enough for Facebook, one of the most popular social networks on the web, it should be good enough for other applications. React also solved many of the past issues that developers had with developing single-page applications (SPAs). React came out when SPAs were becoming popular, and all the existing frameworks to build them made development complicated and prone to bugs. One feature that makes it better than past libraries is that React is relatively easy to use. Its components are reusable, plus React's use of the virtual DOM makes it very performant. React should remain popular in the future as each new release brings new features and performance improvements.</p><p><strong>What is React Native?</strong></p><p>Created by Facebook, React Native is an open-source-based mobile application framework that uses only JavaScript, making it capable of supporting both Android and iOS platforms. React, also known as React.js, saves time and effort for developers since they only need one programming language. The Native element allows developers to create JavaScript components to design software programs that run on various devices and platforms, such as smartphones, smart TVs, and laptops. With React Native, developers use the same concepts used in the original React framework to design a rich mobile user interface (UI) for various environments from existing components.</p><p><strong>What careers use React Native?</strong></p><p>Businesses that want to create mobile apps for iOS and Android simultaneously to ensure a seamless rollout need developers with a background in React Native. Careers in mobile app development that rely on React Native can count on professionals who can design and build stunning UIs in multiple platforms since it works hand-in-hand with platforms like Windows and tvOS. React Native developers are also vital to helping iOS, and Android companies update and otherwise modernize their apps with features like push notifications and animation for better effectiveness for mobile app subscribers. Developers with a background in React Native might work in full-stack development, designing and refining web-based games, websites, mobile apps, and more.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and Google Flutter?</strong></p><p>Google Flutter offers developers a UI toolkit that has some similarities to React Native. Flutter also has a native component and compiles web, mobile, and desktop applications from a single collection of source codes. Relying on existing code, Flutter is also a free and open-source framework for developers. Until this point, the two frameworks might sound similar. However, React Native is based on and only uses JavaScript, while Flutter only has a loose connection to the language. Google Flutter primarily uses a new language called Dart. Other differences between the two involve sourcing the tool itself and the installation process, setup and configuration, UI component and development, and community support.</p><p><strong>What is Angular and what are its benefits?</strong></p><p>Angular is an open-source, client-side framework for building single-page websites and desktop and mobile applications. It is a full-featured JavaScript application built on TypeScript, which operates across platforms and keeps code clean and consistent throughout the codebase. Angular is an all-in-one rapid application development platform that allows web pages to render efficiently by minimizing communication with servers. The Angular framework offers end-to-end tooling or routing, state management, and form validation, as well as dependency injection and declarative templates. Angular offers out-of-the-box functionality and easy updating, along with an extensive collection of pre-made components. The TypeScript base includes high-quality code that reduces the burden of debugging and allows multiple developers to collaborate across platforms with minimal disruption and less coding.</p><p><strong>Is learning Angular hard?</strong></p><p>Angular is a complex application that contains multiple libraries and cross-platform functionalities, so it can take some time to learn its many features. Angular’s learning curve depends partly on your previous knowledge of web development and your familiarity with the languages used in the Angular platform. If you’re new to Angular, it’s helpful to have some familiarity with the basics of web design and the essentials of HTML and CSS. It’s also useful to know about the other languages that make up the Angular framework. These include basic HTML and CSS, as well as ECMAScript6, or ES6, a general programming language designed to ensure interoperability of web pages across the Internet. It’s also helpful to understand TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript used to write Angular. Learning Angular is even easier if you’re familiar with JavaScript, which is an implementation of ES6 and Angular’s base language.</p><p><strong>What is Angular used for?</strong></p><p>Developers mainly use Angular to build dynamic single-page applications (SPAs) for web, mobile, and desktop. SPAs are web pages based on a single HTML file that is completely controlled by JavaScript. When an action such as clicking a button happens on the page, the code renders it on the page instantly without sending a new request to the server. TypeScript and Angular’s other tools, including routing, state management, and ROM validation, make SPA creation easy and fast. Its open-source JavaScript framework allows developers to reuse code across multiple platforms. Angular’s component-based architecture simplifies the development workflow, making it possible to design apps for deployment in a wide range of environments and update them without extensive recoding.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Angular and React?</strong></p><p>Angular and React are both rapid application development (RAD) platforms based on JavaScript. Angular is a multilayered framework that runs on Typescript and is compatible with many different code editors. It is a full-featured web development platform that requires no additional libraries. This means Angular can independently carry out a full range of development functions such as data binding, form validation, and dependency injection. First introduced in 2013, React is a JavaScript library managed by Facebook, and it works for both single- and multi-page web applications. React is a framework for UI development that’s smaller and faster than Angular. However, it requires other libraries or modules to provide the full range of Angular’s functions. React is easy to install and use for anyone who already knows JavaScript, and because it operates with a virtual DOM, the browser load reduces. Angular operates with a real DOM, which leads to longer runtimes and slower performance.</p><p><strong>Is Angular free to use and where can I get it?</strong></p><p>Angular has both free and paid options, but the developer doesn’t provide pricing information about its paid version for enterprises and large organizations; this information is only available with a custom quote. Individual users can also obtain Angular for free from the developer site. This open-source software is available under an MIT license granted by Google, which gives permission to use the Angular application for any purpose without limitation. New users can also download a free trial version of Angular from the developer. This version is a ready-made standalone app that contains most key features of the platform, and you can install it on any computer without taking all the steps to create the full Angular environment. The free Angular app allows users to get started by learning Angular’s key features and creating a basic app of their own.</p><p><strong>What careers use Angular?</strong></p><p>Angular is one of the most popular web development platforms in use today. Skills in using Angular can be helpful for several careers in fields related to web design and development. Angular skills are most important for careers in practical web development, including specialties like frontend development, which involves designing client-facing web elements such as visual content, UI and UX development, and general software development. Software engineers and site designers can also benefit from learning Angular. It is a JavaScript application, so it’s also useful for JavaScript developers. It’s also possible to create a career around a specialization in Angular development alone. Angular development specialists can work as consultants or independent contractors with multiple organizations needing web development services.</p><p><strong>What IDE is best for Angular?</strong></p><p>An integrated development environment, or IDE, is a software application that consolidates essential web developer tools in a single graphical interface, which streamlines the development process and promotes consistency across all relevant platforms. Many IDEs now support Angular development projects, and there’s an option for every budget. The best paid IDE for Angular is Angular IDE. It was developed especially for the platform, so it supports all its features. Angular IDE is available as a standalone plugin or with an Eclipse plugin. New users can get a 45-day free trial before purchasing. Visual Studio Code is a general-purpose IDE that supports multiple development platforms, including Angular. This free, open-source IDE from Microsoft includes support for TypeScript code and several downloadable Angular plugins.</p><p><strong>Video and Audio Production Quality</strong></p><p>All our videos are created/produced as <strong>high-quality video and audio</strong> to provide you the best learning experience. </p><p>You will be,</p><ul><li><p>Seeing clearly</p></li><li><p>Hearing clearly</p></li><li><p>Moving through the course without distractions</p></li></ul><p><strong> You'll also get:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Lifetime Access to The Course</p></li><li><p>Fast &amp; Friendly Support in the Q&amp;A section</p></li><li><p>Udemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download</p></li></ul><p>Dive in now!</p><p> <strong>Full Stack Web Development with ReactJS, React Native, Angular</strong></p><p>We offer&nbsp;<strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions.</p><p>See you in the course!</p>|programmer, google, apps, iphone, superset, microsoft, innovations, updating, modernize, javascript

All gathered for full stack web development in one course!<br><br></strong>Whether you’re using C# in conjunction with Xamarin Forms to build cross-platform apps, or designing a new video game in Unity with C#, Udemy has a course for you. Udemy hosts top-rated courses on everything from the fundamentals of C# programming to more advanced topics like databases and asynchronous programming.<br><br>Even though C# is a language that’s relatively easy to learn and maintain, it isn’t just for beginners. Its scalability and large support community make C# the language of choice for Microsoft app developers and video game developers working with the Unity Engine. Like C++ and Java, C# is a high-level object-oriented programming language. It is generally more efficient than Java and has useful features such as operator overloading. C# is based on C++ but has several advantages over this older language: it is type-safe, more comprehensively object-oriented, and the syntax has been simplified in several important ways. Most importantly, C# interoperates exceptionally well with other languages on the .NET platform. For this reason, C# is a better choice for building applications for .NET.<br><br>Most programmers will choose to learn the object oriented programming paradigm in a specific language. That’s why Udemy features a host of top-rated OOP courses tailored for specific languages, like Java, C#, and Python.<br><br>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming paradigm where a software application is developed by modeling real world objects into software modules called classes. Consider a simple point of sale system that keeps record of products purchased from whole-sale dealers and the products sold to the customer. An object-oriented language would implement these requirements by creating a Product class, a Customer class, a Dealer class and an Order class. All of these classes would interact together to deliver the required functionality where each class would be concerned with storing its own data and performing its own functions. This is the basic idea of object-oriented programming or also called OOP.<br><br>SQL isn’t just for software engineers and system administrators. SQL also helps business analysts gain important insights into new marketplaces and make more informed strategic decisions. SQL instructors on Udemy have experience with all levels and applications of SQL programming.</p><p>SQL is a special-purpose programming language used for the interaction and manipulation of data in relational databases. In DZone’s 2019 Guide to Databases, 98% of developer survey respondents said their organizations use relational databases regularly, which frequently rely on SQL to query the data. With Udemy courses on SQL, you can learn one of the most in-demand skills for professions ranging from product managers to marketers to software engineers.<br><br>ASP.NET MVC is an excellent tool for creating membership websites and fast web applications.

It was designed as a multi-paradigm programming language by Microsoft in around 2000 as part of its .NET initiative. The .NET framework and .NET applications are multi-platform applications that you can use with programming languages such as C++, C#, Visual Basic, and COBOL. C# is open-source and was designed to be simple yet modern, flexible yet powerful and versatile yet easy to learn and program with. Many programming languages in the past were designed for specific purposes. C# was developed with business and enterprise needs in mind. By providing functionality to support modern-day software development such as web applications, mobile, and response app needs, C# supports many features of modern-day programming languages. That includes generics, var types.<br><strong>What are the advantages of c# over C++ ?</strong><br>Thanks to the .NET framework, C# has many advantages over C++. C# is a refined and modernized version of C++. C++ was developed to bring object-orientation to C, an older but widely used language, and C++ became the de-facto language for building applications for Windows as well as infrastructure and low-level applications. Visual Basic was for business applications. What C# does is combine the rapid development capabilities of VB with the power of C++. C# also has many new data types, type-safety, to ensure you do not unknowingly reuse initialized variables. It uses a simplified syntax, a huge improvement over the complex coding often required in C++. C# also removes memory management issues thanks to .NET’s garbage collection scheme. You do not have to reference items for garbage collection; the system can reclaim that memory as required.</p><p><strong>Why use encapsulation in C# ?</strong><br>Encapsulation can be used in C# to hide data and program behavior from users. With encapsulation, you can group properties, methods, and other members so that they are treated as a single object. It is a means to prevent the user of a given class from manipulating program objects in ways that were not intended by the designer or developer. Encapsulation hides how a program operates without affecting how it works while still allowing users to service requests for functionality and add or modify internal data or methods to meet changing needs. For example, suppose you have an object called “Patient” that contains patient-related data. In that case, you can use encapsulation to provision patient-specific data to those who need it without exposing all patient data. In addition to information hiding, you can use encapsulation in C# to improve your code's reusability.<br><strong>What is C# used for?</strong><br>C# is a general-purpose programming language that you can use to build a wide range of programs and applications, such as web applications, Windows applications and game development. In web application development, you can build dynamic websites and apps using .NET or another open-source platform of your choice. Also, since Microsoft created C# for Microsoft, C# is a popular language for building Windows applications. There are rich resources and a vibrant C# community that can support and documentation for applications and programs specific to Microsoft platform architectures, making it easier than ever to develop applications in this space. Finally, C# is a popular language to use in game-building, especially with Unity, a game engine that runs on C++ and C#.</p><p><strong>What is a constructor? What is a destructor?</strong><br>To understand constructors and destructors, we need to understand methods. A method is a block of code that contains a series of statements. Programs run by executing methods. A constructor is a special method of a class that is automatically called whenever an instance of a given class is created. A constructor contains the instructions that execute when an object is created. Developers use it to assign specific initial values to the data members of the same class. In C#, you will get a compile-time error if you try to read from an uninitialized variable. You must first initialize your variables by giving them an initial value, which is what the constructor does. On the other hand, destructors are methods used to destroy instances of a class when they are no longer needed. Destructors are called implicitly by the garbage collector in .NET</p><p><strong>How do I learn C#?</strong><br>As is true for many skills, you can learn C# by taking Udemy courses, reading documentation, and practicing coding hands-on. There are many resources available for all of the above, including real-time compiler applications that will show you the output of your code as you type it. However, it is best to plan ahead, and you should have an outline of what you need to learn before beginning your journey. The first thing to learn about is what C# is, how and where it is used, and why it was developed. From there, you can learn about data types, variables, keywords, and functions. Once you’ve grasped the basics, you can move on to learning about conditional tests and operators, functions, arguments, object orientation, arrays, strings, classes, methods, structs, debugging, and exception handling.<br><strong>What is SQL and how is it used?</strong><br>SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a language used to manage data in a relational database. It allows you to query, manipulate, and define the data in a relational database. It has become a standard language, which means that the language the database uses will be based on SQL despite which relational database you use. This makes it a very versatile language and an important skill to have if you work with databases or data. The language closely resembles English, making it easy for English-speakers to learn and read at a glance, even for a beginner. Statements consist of clauses, identifiers, operators, and constants. Together, you can create statements such as “SELECT customer_name FROM Purchase_Table WHERE order_number = 253”. The resulting statement is structured so a computer can read, yet also easy for English-speakers with little programming</p><p><strong>What job use sql?</strong><br>Many career paths benefit from understanding SQL. Almost any industry that uses data can benefit from someone that specializes in relational databases. Some jobs specifically focus on working with a database, such as a Database Manager or Database Developer role. However, more and more jobs that do not solely concentrate on database maintenance require knowledge of SQL. Mostly all websites and applications use a database, so various developer positions require knowledge of SQL. Similarly, careers that involve working with data require skills in SQL. These careers can include Data Scientists, Database Developer, DB Admins, Business Analysts, Data Analysts, Big Data Experts, and Big Data Architects. Occupations that involve a database are growing. As the amount of data we collect increases, careers around the management, analysis.</p><p><strong>What is sql injection?</strong><br>SQL injection is a common hacking technique. It uses SQL commands to manipulate a database. It can occur when an application has been poorly developed and allows a user to insert information directly into a database. For example, if you ask a user to submit their name, a hacker can type in a SQL command instead. If that command directly executes against the database of the application an injection attack has occurred. For a database, a command is a command and it cannot determine whether a command is from a valid user or not. Because this is a common threat, it is easy to prevent. A golden rule of database management is to never input user data directly into the database. Many programming languages will have a function that checks for SQL injections. So, it is pretty easy to guard yourself against an SQL injection attack.</p><p><strong>How long does it take to learn SQL?</strong></p><p>You should expect to learn the basics of the language in less than a month, or even as little as 2 weeks, if you are dedicated. But to be comfortable and perform non-trivial operations, it takes a few months to get your bearings in SQL. Because SQL is close to the English language, it is not very difficult to read, write, and understand if you're familiar with the English language. Even if you have no programming background, you should be able to learn SQL quickly. It does take a lot of practice to become a good SQL developer. Reading and writing SQL is just one component of being a SQL programmer. It is even more important to know how to structure data and manage relationships between tables. You need a deep understanding of relational databases to create a data structure that will work well with the type of data you have gathered.<br><strong>What is the best SQL certification?</strong><br>You don’t need a certification to get a job working with SQL, but it can help you stand out in the crowd. The certification you choose will depend on your career goals. If you know that you will be working with a specific database, working on a certification for that specific area could give you an advantage. Most of the SQL language is cross-compatible across all relational database platforms so if you have done enough practice in one of them, learning for another one will be fairly quick and easy.<br><strong>What is the best way to learn SQL?</strong><br>Because SQL is so similar to the English language, it is pretty easy to learn on your own. You can learn it quickly by going through online tutorials that teach the syntax and keywords in the language. But, to get good at SQL, you will want to practice and work with data regularly. Therefore, some people may find it easier to learn by following a tutorial, taking a course, or getting a certification. These methods often provide structured exercises and/or assignments, which allow you to practice the skills you are learning. This type of experience will help you to progress faster.<br><strong>What is a relational database?</strong></p><p>A relational database is a type of database that stores data that is organized in structures called tables and these tables are related to one another through defined relationships. Each table has columns and rows. Columns represent attributes and define a structure to the data. Each row is a record of information stored in the table. The relationships between tables are defined by assigning certain columns as foreign and primary keys. For example, a vehicle table might contain the VIN number as a primary key since that uniquely identifies each record of information about a car. There may be another table in the database called dealerships. The data can be structured in such a way that each car belongs to some dealership. The relationship between these 2 tables can be organized by having the dealership’s key in the vehicles table.</p><p><strong>What are the most common forms of SQL and how do they differ?</strong></p><p>There are many forms of SQL, but PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL, and MySQL are the three most widely used. Although each of these forms is an implementation of SQL, their standards were set by different organizations. PostgreSQL and MySQL are both open-source platforms maintained by a wide community of developers, while Microsoft develops Microsoft SQL. Syntactically, they can differ regarding whether they require case sensitivity, whether they use single quotes or double quotes, and what functions they support. As an example, Microsoft SQL server uses GETDATE(), MySQL uses CURDATE(), and PostgreSQL uses CURRENT_DATE(). They also differ in languages supported; MySQL supports languages that PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL don't, such as Haskell and Ruby. As Microsoft SQL is proprietary, it costs money to license</p><p><strong>Why would you want to take this course?</strong>&nbsp; </p><p>Our answer is simple: The quality of teaching. </p><p>When you enroll, you will feel the OAK Academy`s seasoned instructors' expertise.&nbsp; </p><p>This course starts with&nbsp;very basics.&nbsp; You will learn everything with <strong>hands-on practices.&nbsp; </strong>I'll also teach you<strong>&nbsp;the best practices&nbsp;and shortcuts</strong>. </p><p><strong>Video and Audio Production Quality</strong></p><p>All our videos are created/produced as <strong>high-quality video and audio</strong> to provide you the best learning experience. </p><p>You will be,</p><ul><li><p>Seeing clearly</p></li><li><p>Hearing clearly</p></li><li><p>Moving through the course without distractions</p></li></ul><p><strong> You'll also get:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Lifetime Access to The Course</p></li><li><p>Fast &amp; Friendly Support in the Q&amp;A section</p></li><li><p>Udemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>Are you ready to dive in now to my <strong>Full Stack Web Development with C# OOP, MS SQL &amp; ASP.NET MVC </strong>course</p><p>We offer&nbsp;<strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions.</p><p>See you in the course!</p>|cobol, online, scientists, android, tutorials, python, google, programmer, apps, microsoft

You’ll notice that there isn’t a standard screen size. Without CSS, rendering a website’s text, layout, and design for these discrepancies in screens would be impossible. CSS is the backbone of all website styling work, and is rightfully considered a cornerstone of internet technology.</p><p><strong>CSS</strong> or <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong> is a style sheet language used to style markup language. <strong>Markup languages</strong> include <strong>HTML, XHML, XML, and other XML-based</strong> languages. The most common use of CSS is to style HTML web pages. Although HTML doesn't need CSS to function, every web page would look the same without it. With CSS, you can target specific elements in a web page and change the look and arrangement on the page. CSS can make an embedded image small or cover the entire webpage as a background. You can enlarge a heading and apply a specific font to stand out from the rest of the page.</p><p><br></p><p>In this course you will learn to develop web applications with <strong>Vue JS, Vuex</strong> from scratch.</p><p>If you are thinking to realize your dream web application, this course is for you.</p><p>We have explained <strong>Vue</strong> and <strong>Vuex </strong>from beginner to all levels.

You can also use it to create one-page applications and handle animations, interactive elements, and graphics. Generating projects is also possible with the user-built presets, which is commonly applicable for coders working in enterprise environments. Because it is based on JavaScript, you can easily integrate Vue into an existing JS project. Vue uses the traditional Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which means that the core library of Vue.js focuses on the view layer by default. It enforces a one-way data flow between components. This also makes it easy for you to integrate with other libraries or existing projects. Vue also uses virtual DOM (Document Object Model), which makes it faster than regular DOM. Instead of re-rendering the whole page, Vue only updates the objects that you change.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Vue and React?</strong></p><p>Although Vue has an MVC architecture, you cannot use it with a different architectural approach, which differs from the Component Based Architecture (CBA) used in React. They also differ in how they optimize data. When a component’s state changes in React, it triggers the re-render of the entire component sub-tree, starting at that component as the root. Vue automatically tracks a component’s dependencies during its render, so the system knows which components actually need to re-render when the state changes. In React, everything is in JavaScript. Vue, on the other hand, embraces web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and allows you to build off of them. Another difference between these frameworks is how you can scale up your projects. React only offers a single template that assumes you’re building a single-page application, while Vue offers several default options for multiple purposes and build systems.</p><p><strong>Is Vue JS easy to learn?</strong></p><p>Vue JS can be easy to learn. Unlike other frontend technologies, Vue doesn’t require in-depth knowledge of libraries. If you want to start learning Vue, all you need to have is basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Compared to other coding technologies, developers typically classify Vue.js as having an easy learning curve. This is due largely in part to Vue’s reputation for having an elegant programming style and patterns. Because Vue is a progressive framework, it makes it easy for you to use it to integrate into an existing project. Because of its familiar templating syntax and use of components, you may find that integrating or migrating existing projects to Vue is fairly straightforward. Vue is known for offering a vast ecosystem of tools and companion libraries, making it a simple framework that you can use to respond to the complex needs of enterprise-grade applications.</p><p><strong>What is Vuex used for?</strong></p><p>Vuex is <strong>a state management pattern + library for Vue.</strong> <strong>js applications</strong>. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion.</p><p><strong>What is difference between Vue and Vuex?</strong></p><p>Vue is a progressive Javascript framework and Vuex is the state management tool. We can use redux or flux inside Vue, But Vuex<strong> </strong>is native to the Vue.</p><p><strong>Why do I need Vuex?</strong></p><p>Vuex is a popular way to handle a complex app's authentication in Vue. With Vuex, you're able to handle the token's availability and access controls and route blocks throughout your app. Mutations, getters, and setters assist with this task.</p><p><strong>How does Vuex store work?</strong></p><p>It works by having a central store for shared state, and providing methods to allow any component in your application to access that state. In essence, Vuex ensures your views remain consistent with your application data, regardless of which function triggers a change to your application data.</p><p><strong>When Should I Use It?</strong></p><p>Vuex helps us deal with shared state management with the cost of more concepts and boilerplate. It's a trade-off between short term and long term productivity.</p><p>If you've never built a large-scale SPA and jump right into Vuex, it may feel verbose and daunting. That's perfectly normal- if your app is simple, you will most likely be fine without Vuex. A simple store pattern (opens new window)may be all you need. But if you are building a medium-to-large-scale SPA, chances are you have run into situations that make you think about how to better handle state outside of your Vue components, and Vuex will be the natural next step for you.</p><p><strong>What is JavaScript?</strong></p><p><strong>JavaScript </strong>is a curly-braced, dynamically typed, prototype-based, object-oriented programming language. It started as the programming language for the web and is one of the three layers of standard web technologies — the other two being HTML and CSS. JavaScript allows you to create and control content dynamically on a web page without requiring a page reload. Web browsers are able to interpret it, and when triggered by events, modify the HTML and CSS of a web page with dynamic updates. JavaScript also uses asynchronous calls to fetch data from web services in the background. Although it was initially only used in web browsers, JavaScript engines have since been put to use as servers with Node.js, included in desktop application frameworks like Electron, and embedded in phone frameworks like Apache Cordova.</p><p><strong>Why is JavaScript important?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is the programming language that allows users to interact with the websites that they're visiting, making it a very important language for web developers to know. In the past, most developers focused on the backend; JavaScript was only relevant when they needed to use visual effects. As web development evolved and the focus shifted towards user experience, programmers started to rely on JavaScript for their frontend code heavily. Today, most sites use JavaScript to fetch and submit data, use logic, and generate HTML in browsers. JavaScript can also communicate asynchronously with data servers in the background without interrupting the user interaction in the foreground. These features make JavaScript not only an important language but a necessary language for modern web development.</p><p><strong>What are the main uses of JavaScript?</strong></p><p>JavaScript is a text-based programming language used for client- and server-side development. Web developers have used JavaScript since its inception to add simple interactivity to web pages like modals, animated elements, or image slideshows. While that is still one of its primary uses, Javascript has evolved to building complete web applications. SPAs, or single page applications, depend on JavaScript-based frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue to bring a desktop-like application experience to the browser. However, it's important to note that web browsers aren't places that make good use of the programming language. Javascript is also popular for building web services and back-end infrastructure with Node.js. React Native, Xamarin, Ionic, and NativeScript frameworks use JavaScript for developing phone apps as well.</p><p><strong>React vs. Angular vs. Vue: what is the best JavaScript framework?</strong></p><p>Choosing the best JavaScript framework for your web project depends on what you are looking for. React is a popular framework, which means you will find a lot of community support if you need help. It is also considered relatively easy to learn but is being developed at a rapid pace. Angular is a framework that makes data binding easy so that you can template an application faster. It also uses the RxJS library to simplify asynchronous programming and Typescript (which compiles to JavaScript) for a cleaner, less error-prone development process. Some cons of Angular are that it can have a steep learning curve and can be complex. Vue is a lightweight framework, so it is easy to learn, very performant, and flexible. Some cons of Vue are limited plugins, and its flexibility can lead to irregular code.</p><p><strong>What is JSON and what is it used for?</strong></p><p>Because of the evolution of the JavaScript language, JavaScript has a variety of techniques for creating objects. But, ultimately in the background, JavaScript is using a syntax called JSON. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a standard text-based format used to represent objects in JavaScript. The same basic types of data represented in Javascript can also be represented in JSON, including strings, numbers, arrays, booleans, and JavaScript objects. Although JSON is based on the JavaScript object, it is not just used in JavaScript. It is also used as a format to transfer data from a web browser to a server and vice versa because of the format's simplicity and small size. The JSON format is used in REST APIs for this purpose and has replaced XML as the standard format for many APIs. Because of this, just about any language you use will have a method of converting data into JSON to interact with REST APIs.</p><p><strong>What is AJAX and what is it used for?</strong></p><p>AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is a technology that developers use to create better, faster and more interactive web applications. AJAX uses XHTML for content, CSS to style the page, and JavaScript for controlling content dynamically. AJAX allows you to update a web page without reloading the page (this technique is called a “SPA” or Single Page Application), request data for the page after it has loaded, receive data after the page has loaded, and send data to the server in the background. Despite XML being part of the acronym that makes up AJAX, AJAX can send and receive data in any format, including JSON or plain text. While traditional web applications use synchronous methods to send and receive information from a web server, AJAX can use asynchronous API calls in the background without blocking activity in the browser. AJAX is a data-driven rather than a page-driven technology.</p><p><strong>How can I teach myself Javascript?</strong></p><p>One of the best ways to learn to write code is through an online course that teaches you how to write JavaScript with an instructor that will explain the code, what versions you should use, and why. Learning to develop a real-world application, with an instructor explaining in a step-by-step fashion, will teach you modern code techniques.</p><p><strong>What is the best IDE for Javascript?</strong></p><p>With all of the different JavaScript IDEs available, the best option depends on how you intend to use it, along with your personal preferences. Webstorm is a popular JavaScript IDE from JetBrains. It provides fast static code analysis, integrated testing, local history, code refactoring, and debugging. While the IDE requires a paid subscription, many developers swear by it because of its compatibility with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Those searching for a free option might prefer VS Code. This general-purpose, open-source IDE comes with IntelliSense, Git integration, and debugging features built-in. Many third-party extensions are available to add new language and programming features, making it one of the more flexible choices. Atom is another general-purpose IDE that is popular with JavaScript developers. It is also free, open-source, and has third-party extensions to add functionality.</p><p><strong>What is Node.Js and what is it used for?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is a server environment built for fast and easily scalable network applications. It was built on Chrome’s JavaScript runtime and uses an event-driven, non-blocking model that makes it the best fit for applications that run on distributed devices and need to run in real-time. By using JavaScript, node.Js can be put to work by many software developers familiar with JavaScript. Because the code is open-source, you can also use it on any platform (Mac OS, Windows, or Linux). Node.js is the architecture for creating websites and real-time applications because it’s easy for teams to learn, and it’s fast. Examples of applications that use node.Js include video conferencing apps, chat servers, eCommerce software, and collaborative online gaming.</p><p><strong>What are the advantages of Node.Js?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is open-source, meaning it’s a free code for all developers. On top of that, it also means that there is a thriving community of Node.Js users and programmers that all add to the knowledge base. Many are happy to share their flavor of the code with other developers, and collectively, the Node.Js environment continues to be enhanced. Because Node.Js uses JavaScript, there is a large pool of developers that understand and can code in the environment. It’s also a relatively simple environment for new team members to learn, making it an efficient choice for development teams with people that need training. Node.Js was developed on Push technology instead of web sockets, which is why it’s the preferred choice for real-time communication applications and programs that need to be highly scalable.</p><p><strong>What does it mean that Node.Js is a runtime system?</strong></p><p>A runtime system is a platform where a software program runs. It’s essentially an environment housing the collection of software and hardware that allows an application to execute (or run). Node.Js is a runtime system because it provides the environment necessary for applications to run within it, and no additional code or hardware is required. Because Node.Js makes use of JavaScript, it’s a runtime system that provides a framework where you can use JavaScript to create and run programs. The JavaScript programming language (which is quite popular) is then automatically translated into machine code for the hardware to run the program in real-time. It’s an efficient system, making it the preferred choice for many software and tech companies.</p><p><strong>What is microservices architecture and how can Node.Js be used for it?</strong></p><p>Microservices architecture is a software development style or method where single-function modules originate. Each has a very well-defined operation and interface and can deploy on its own. In essence, it’s a way of developing modules that you can repurpose from one program or application to another. When you create an application, it’s a collection of modules that have been thoroughly tested and are well-maintained. The modules are typically built around different business-specific capabilities and are then loosely coupled to other modules when deployed as part of a program. You can use Node.Js in microservices architecture as the language of choice for one, some, or all of the microservices (or modules). The beauty of microservices is that you can use the best language for the specific microservice. But where highly scalable, fast programs are needed, Node.Js would be a top contender.</p><p><strong>What is HTML and why is it important?</strong></p><p>HTML stands for a hyper-text markup language. Whether on a mobile device or a computer, every website that you browse is designed with HTML. HTML isn’t a “programming language,” but rather a “formatting language.” It tells a browser how to display text, images, and other media elements. When HTML was first developed, it was fairly simple. For example, the text on a page could be bolded, italicized, or underlined, and images could be resized and aligned. Today, HTML is much more complex and dynamic, allowing front-end developers to create any layout or setup they desire.</p><p><strong>Why is CSS and Javascript important for HTML?</strong></p><p>HTML<strong> </strong>is a formatting language, not a programming language. Javascript is often necessary to make HTML “dynamic.” While HTML can make it so that text is displayed on the screen, Javascript can update this text or make it move. Javascript is used for both front-end and back-end development, hand-in-hand with HTML, to create complex and attractive web designs. Meanwhile, <strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> are used to organize the look and feel of a website and make the website easier to update and manipulate. Today, HTML, CSS, and Javascript are frequently used to develop responsive web designs — designs that react to a user’s environment for a better user experience.</p><p><strong>What is an HTML element and why is it important?</strong></p><p>HTML is designed on a modular basis, meaning every part of the web page has a specific “place.” An HTML element is a part of the page. Common HTML elements include “&lt;p&gt;” for a “paragraph” and “&lt;title&gt;” for the “title” of the page. In fact, the entirety of the HTML page is within the “&lt;html&gt;” element. Elements are begun and ended with tags, so a title would be written: “&lt;title&gt;This is the Title to the page.&lt;/title&gt;” Organizing code this way makes it easier to reference and control. Each element may also have characteristics. For instance, the “&lt;p&gt;” (paragraph) tag can be aligned in a certain direction. These are the basic building blocks of HTML and what most designers should learn first.</p><p><strong>Is HTML a programming language?</strong></p><p>HTML is not considered a programming language but rather a markup or formatting language. This is an important distinction. Formatting languages merely control how things are displayed on a visual level, whereas programming languages are more dynamic; they use logic gates to determine the behavior of a program. But there is some crossover. “DHTML,” for instance, refers to Dynamic HTML. It is a type of HTML augmented by Javascript to make it easier to adjust on the fly. Because HTML, Javascript, and CSS are so frequently used together, they can often be folded together, which can contribute to some confusion regarding whether HTML is a programming language.</p><p><strong>Is HTML hard to learn?</strong></p><p>HTML is known as one of the easiest languages to learn. It’s also one of the most ubiquitous. Many individuals interested in front-end, back-end, or full-stack development will learn HTML first. While HTML is largely intended for websites as a language, it is also used in many other programs. For example, when you create an email signature, you will usually be using HTML. Emails themselves use a combination of HTML and CSS. An advantage (and an occasional double-edged sword) to HTML is that it is very forgiving. You can get some HTML wrong, and your page will still be displayed, if not exactly how you want it to be.</p><p><strong>What jobs use HTML?</strong></p><p>Nearly any development or design job will require a cursory understanding of HTML. HTML has also evolved dramatically since it was originally developed; it is far more complex and standardized than before. Because of this, even those who have been experts in HTML during their career may need to undergo an HTML refresher periodically. Most jobs that require HTML will involve web design, web development, or layout and design. For example, someone who manages a content management system such as WordPress may not need to know any other programming languages but should still know HTML basics. Similarly, someone who formats online newsletters or an online magazine in an administrative capacity may not need to be a web designer or web developer but might need to understand the principles of HTML.</p><p><strong>What is responsive design?</strong></p><p>Responsive design is a new type of design intended to respond to the platform and environment that a user is on. When HTML was created, most people used PCs. Today, people can browse a website on a PC, phone, tablet, or even a game console. In the past, developers created separate sites for “desktop” and “mobile.” While it worked, it wasn't easy to maintain. Rather than creating separate sites, responsive design generates the site based on the environment it detects. This greatly reduces the amount of development and maintenance for the site. Responsive design is generally achieved with a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p><p><strong>What is Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)?</strong></p><p><strong>CSS </strong>or <strong>Cascading Style Sheets </strong>is a style sheet language used to style markup language. Markup languages include HTML, XHML, XML, and other XML-based languages. The most common use of CSS is to style HTML web pages. Although HTML doesn't need CSS to function, every web page would look the same without it.<p>|browsers, web, hypertext, plugins, xhtml, nodejs, apps, html, html5, javascript

I liked the author’s approach to start with explaining methods and then expanding it to classes, objects and others. This course is good value for the money.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Knowledge Notes!</strong></p><p><strong>What is Spring Boot REST?</strong></p><p>I don’t want to get too technical (Assuming that you are beginner). This was explained well in detail in the course. But roughly speaking, the main purpose of REST API is to decouple presentation from Business and Data tier, so that the same code can be used for both Mobile and Web applications.</p><p>In other words, a REST API will not return HTML, like in case of traditional applications. But, will return Data. Because, guess what! HTML works on browsers but not on mobile app.<br><br>‘Spring Boot’ on the other hand will help us develop spring apps in rapid manner. Basically, it follows “convention over configuration” principle. Which means, with spring boot, developers can focus on writing the code that matters and don’t have to take care of configurations and other boilerplate code.</p><p>This is all discussed in the course, in detail.</p><p><strong>What is reactive programming in Spring boot REST?</strong></p><p>Again! This was explained well in the course, but to put it simply, reactive programming will reduce the thread wait time on the server. So that, more requests can be processed at a time.</p><p>If you want to know ‘How’! Then, it’s hard to explain in typing. It’s explained well in the course.</p><p><strong>What is Angular?</strong></p><p>Traditional apps used to return HTML and so they can be rendered directly on the browser. But, a REST API will return ‘Data’ without presentation.</p><p>So then, who will take care of presentation part? Well, you guessed it. Angular!</p><p>Angular is an application that runs on the browser and acts like a client app for REST API. Angular is much more than just that though! Better check out the course lectures.</p><p>I hope to see you in the course. Either way, I wish you good luck for your future endeavors!</p><p><br></p><p>Your well wisher,</p><p>Karthikeya T</p>|teaching, requisite, teamplate, trainer, classes, spring, mentored, tutor, postman, hiring

One of the biggest advantages of Java is that it runs on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), meaning that you can execute Java code on any platform that has a JVM, without re-compilation. This is different from C and C++, which require re-compilation for every hardware platform you execute the code on. Java has many other advantages, including automatic memory management. This eliminates hard-to-understand pointers used in languages like C, which can help Java developers write better code in a shorter period of time.</p><p><strong>What does it mean that Java is an object-oriented programming language?</strong></p><p>Java is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, which means concepts or things are represented as “objects” that have data fields and methods. In object-oriented programming, models called “objects” represent either a programming entity or an abstract concept. These objects are created and assembled independently of one another but can work with each other in logical ways. Objects are manifestations of classes and can inherit code allowing for code re-use, which can drastically reduce code duplication if used correctly. Additionally, encapsulation, another core OOP concept, allows you to create code with the implementation hidden. Although, in many cases, writing OOP code in Java (and other OOP languages) can take longer than using a procedural language, the benefits obtained with OOP, namely code reusability, encapsulation of data, and readability of code, often result in code that is easier to maintain in the long run.</p><p><strong>What is Java used for?</strong></p><p>Java is a very versatile language. Several fields use Java, including Android app development, desktop applications that work on many operating systems, server-side applications, and more. The virtual machine required to run Java programs has been ported to numerous operating systems allowing Java to run on virtually all hardware. According to the TIOBE index, Java has consistently been in the top 3 most-used and popular languages since its initial release in the 1990s. Many developers still consider Java the language of choice in areas such as enterprise and application servers, and even in embedded systems development. Many Fortune 500 companies rely on Java to run their core systems and employers often view Java experience on a résumé as favorable due to its popularity.</p><p><strong>What certification is best for Java?</strong></p><p>Oracle, the owner of the Java programming language, has the Oracle Certified Developer: Java SE 11 Developer program, which is easily the best certification to obtain for Java developers. The main reason why it’s the best certification, is, unlike most other certifications for Java, the Oracle certification is both well known and universally accepted by employers all over the world. The exam is challenging. You also must bring an ID with you to the exam, so you cannot get anyone to take it for you. Certification is really valuable for both the certification holder and for future employers. There are few, if any, other certification programs so universally accepted as Oracle’s Java certification. Thus, getting Java certification is one of the surest ways to give yourself an advantage over other job seekers in the marketplace.</p><p><strong>What are the pros and cons of Java?</strong></p><p>Java is a very popular language and has been for over 20 years. Because of its popularity, it’s built up a huge range of frameworks, toolkits, tutorials, and support. Not to mention, Java developers have a huge number of career opportunities. Another pro of Java is platform independence. A wide variety of computer hardware and operating systems can use Java. Java is also relatively easy to learn and relatively secure. Java runs on its own virtual machine, via byte-code. When compared to traditional languages like C++ that compile to native machine code, Java’s performance can be slower for applications that are time-critical. Java code is verbose and requires much more code to achieve the same functionality compared to languages such as Python. Overall, developers will likely continue to use Java for many years to come because of its popularity and huge adoption.</p><p><strong>What is Spring Framework?</strong></p><p>Spring Framework is a backend framework for enterprise application development written in Java. Because Java is platform-independent, applications written in Spring Framework can be deployed to any platform. This also makes it possible for developers to focus on creating application logic while Spring Framework handles all the interaction with the operating system. Core parts of Spring Framework include the IoC container, which handles the configuration of application objects; the Data access framework, which allows developers to write simple code to store and retrieve data that is stored in databases; and Spring MVC framework, which gives developers tools to structure applications according to the Model-View-Controller pattern. These and other parts of Spring work together and make building applications for enterprise quicker, easier, and more trouble-free.</p><p><strong>What careers use Spring Framework?</strong></p><p>There are many careers available in enterprise development for programmers that know Spring Framework. In fact, a large majority of Java development jobs require knowledge of Spring. The type of work you do with Spring Framework can vary since it is so flexible. A Spring Java developer designs and builds large-scale applications for enterprises that have high availability and performance. A Spring application developer specializes in creating client applications that run on workstations and laptops. A Java Springboot developer develops web applications and microservices with Spring Framework. A Java backend developer uses Spring Framework to create the server-side code of web applications. A Java e-commerce developer uses Spring Framework for handling customer orders and processing payments.</p><p><strong><em>Why would you want to take this course?</em></strong></p><p>Our answer is simple: The quality of teaching.</p><p>When you enroll Java Programming online course, you will feel the OAK Academy`s seasoned developers' expertise.</p><p><strong><em>This course will take you from a beginner to a more experienced level.</em></strong></p><p>This course takes you from absolute beginner core concepts, like showing you the free tools you need to download and install, to writing your very first program.

The simplest definition of React is that it is a user interface library used for building UI components for the web. But if that was all React did, it would be little more than a template library. Developers define components in React by using an HTML-like syntax called JSX. These encapsulated components manage their own state, making it simple to pass rich data to a component and keep the state of the application and its components out of the Document Object Model (DOM). These features give React components the ability to react dynamically and efficiently to changes in their state. A set of simple components in React can be composed into either simple single-page applications or large, complex web applications.</p><p><strong>What is React used for?</strong></p><p>React is an open-source JavaScript frontend library. Some developers consider it a frontend framework because it does more than standard libraries usually do. The most common use of React is to build dynamic user interfaces for single-page web applications. But the structure of React makes it useful for more than just creating websites. JSX, which is one feature of React, is a syntax extension for Javascript that provides a template for the HTML and manages the state of the element. But JSX can be used as an interface for things other than HTML. React Native uses React to build mobile applications. Here, JSX becomes an interface for mobile UIs instead of HTML. There are even a few libraries that use React and JSX to interact with and manage hardware like React Hardware.</p><p><strong>How does React work?</strong></p><p>React encourages engineers to write code using a Functional Programming approach. Engineers create components, which are normal Javascript functions. These functions return information to tell React what content should be displayed on the screen. The real power of React comes from the ability to nest or compose these functions inside of one another. This nesting ability encourages code reuse and allows an engineer to write a component a single time, but in many different places.</p><p><strong>Is React a framework or library?</strong></p><p>Frameworks provide an opinionated approach to building an entire application. Libraries, on the other hand, assist in building a single aspect of an application. With this in mind, React is a library. It assists engineers in presenting HTML in the browser. React has no opinions on how data is fetched, how styling is applied, or how the app is deployed or built.</p><p><strong>Is React worth learning?</strong></p><p>Yes, React is worth learning. There are a couple of reasons. The first one is that React is in high demand in the software development job market and has been for a few years. If you learn to code in React and can do it well, you will increase your chances of finding a job. This alone is another reason it is worth learning. Website users no longer will settle for old-fashioned sites that won't update without a page reload. React’s method of dynamically updating the HTML of a web page fits these users' needs and improves their experience. React has also been around a few years and has stood the test of time. A large portion of websites, both small and large, use React as a frontend framework.</p><p><strong>Is React hard to learn?</strong></p><p>Every technology or programming language has a learning curve, and React is no different. But it is easy to learn if you are dedicated and determined to create frontend web applications. To make learning React simpler, you should stick to the basics of React before you add any extra libraries, as that will only complicate your learning experience in the beginning. Since React is a Javascript framework, a solid grounding in Javascript will give you a head start. With this knowledge, the unique concept of JSX, React's templating language, and the way React uses state will be much easier to grasp.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and ReactJS, and which one should I learn?</strong></p><p>React, or React JS, is a front-end Javascript library for building UI components for the web. If you are interested in web development, React is the perfect library to learn to create interactive, dynamic single-page apps, or even full-scale web applications. React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications for both the Android phone and Apple's iPhone. React Native is still React, which means the syntax and workflow for building applications are basically the same, but the generated components are different. In React, web components are generated. In React Native, the generated components interact with a phone's native APIs. If your focus is web development, then you should learn React. If you want to build mobile applications, it is best to learn React first and become familiar with the technology before you try React Native.</p><p><strong>Why is React so popular?</strong></p><p>There are many reasons why React is popular. One reason is that Facebook developed it. The social proof is that if it is good enough for Facebook, one of the most popular social networks on the web, it should be good enough for other applications. React also solved many of the past issues that developers had with developing single-page applications (SPAs). React came out when SPAs were becoming popular, and all the existing frameworks to build them made development complicated and prone to bugs. One feature that makes it better than past libraries is that React is relatively easy to use. Its components are reusable, plus React's use of the virtual DOM makes it very performant. React should remain popular in the future as each new release brings new features and performance improvements.</p><p><strong>What is Node.Js and what is it used for?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is a server environment built for fast and easily scalable network applications. It was built on Chrome’s JavaScript runtime and uses an event-driven, non-blocking model that makes it the best fit for applications that run on distributed devices and need to run in real-time. By using JavaScript, node.Js can be put to work by many software developers familiar with JavaScript. Because the code is open-source, you can also use it on any platform (Mac OS, Windows, or Linux). Node.js is the architecture for creating websites and real-time applications because it’s easy for teams to learn, and it’s fast. Examples of applications that use node.Js include video conferencing apps, chat servers, eCommerce software, and collaborative online gaming.</p><p><strong>What are the advantages of Node.Js?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is open-source, meaning it’s free code for all developers. On top of that, it also means that there is a thriving community of Node.Js users and programmers that all add to the knowledge base. Many are happy to share their flavor of the code with other developers, and collectively, the Node.Js environment continues to be enhanced. Because Node.Js uses JavaScript, there is a large pool of developers that understand and can code in the environment. It’s also a relatively simple environment for new team members to learn, making it an efficient choice for development teams with people that need training. Node.Js was developed on Push technology instead of web sockets, which is why it’s the preferred choice for real-time communication applications and programs that need to be highly scalable.</p><p><strong>What does it mean that Node.Js is a runtime system?</strong></p><p>A runtime system is a platform where a software program runs. It’s essentially an environment housing the collection of software and hardware that allows an application to execute (or run). Node.Js is a runtime system because it provides the environment necessary for applications to run within it, and no additional code or hardware is required. Because Node.Js makes use of JavaScript, it’s a runtime system that provides a framework where you can use JavaScript to create and run programs. The JavaScript programming language (which is quite popular) is then automatically translated into machine code for the hardware to run the program in real-time. It’s an efficient system, making it the preferred choice for many software and tech companies.</p><p><strong><em>Fresh Content</em></strong></p><p>It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate.

2038962|Firebase In Depth|899|/course/firebase-course/|fullstack|0|4.6|en|Angular University|<p><strong>This Course in a Nutshell</strong></p><p>If you are looking for the <strong>best backend to go along with your Angular frontend</strong>, then the Firebase ecosystem (with the Firestore NoSQL database) is the right choice for you.</p><p>Today, it's simpler than ever to develop Firebase applications thanks to the latest Firebase development tools, including the awesome <strong>local emulator</strong> (covered in detail in the course).</p><p>Firebase allows us to build applications in a mostly serverless way, in the sense that when using it we only have to write a little bit of server-side code, if any at all in a lot of cases.</p><p>With Firebase, we can not only query our database but also do data modification operations <em>straight from the browser</em>, in a secure way. So how is this possible?</p><p>The way that this works is that the Firestore database enables us to declaratively accept or deny incoming requests using Firestore Security Rules.</p><p>A key ingredient for this to work is Firebase Authentication, which we will cover in detail in this course. Firebase is, of course, frontend agnostic, meaning that it will work with any frontend technology. So why does it work especially well with Angular?</p><p>This is due to the powerful AngularFire library, which allows us to easily query and modify Firestore data <em>in a reactive way</em> using the AngularFire Observable-based API.</p><p>Besides Firestore, the Firebase ecosystem provides everything else that you need for building a fully functioning backend solution. This includes <strong>secure file upload</strong> via Firebase Storage and the hosting of your static files via Firebase Hosting.</p><p>For the rare cases when you need some server-side code, you can do that too in Firebase using Firebase Cloud Functions, which are node-based stateless functions running on the Google Cloud infrastructure.</p><p>Using Cloud Functions, you can implement server-only functionality like database triggers, or even REST endpoints for operations that can only be done on the server, such as user creation, or payments.</p><p>The Firebase ecosystem provides a complete solution for quickly building the backend of your web application, allowing you to focus more of your development time on the frontend.</p><p><strong>Course Overview</strong></p><p>In this course, we are going to take a sample Angular application and we are going to connect it to a Firestore database. We will learn how to do all sorts of database queries and we will provide a <strong>complete CRUD example using AngularFire</strong>.</p><p>We will set up the <strong>local development emulator</strong> from the very beginning, which will allow us to use a local database with predefined authentication users and some initial data.</p><p>The emulator will also allow us to test cloud functions locally as well as security rules, which is super convenient.</p><p>From there, we are going to add security to the application, starting with authentication using Firebase Authentication. We will implement both email and password and social login using the Firebase UI library.</p><p>We are also going to implement <strong>role-based authorization</strong> using Firebase Authentication custom claims and the AngularFire Authentication router guard.</p><p>We will implement an administration screen that allows an existing administrator to create other users, including other administrators in a secure way.</p><p>For this, we will need some backend code, so we will be using Firebase Cloud Functions for that. We will also show how to use Cloud Functions to implement other commonly used backend features, such as database triggers.</p><p>We will show how to do secure file upload of an image thumbnail using Firebase Storage.</p><p>We will end the course by doing a full production deployment using Firebase Hosting, and testing everything out in a non-emulated production environment.</p><p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p><p>This course will go over the following topics:</p><ul><li><p>Introduction to NoSQL data modeling</p></li><li><p>Documents vs Collections</p></li><li><p>Firestore Unique Identifiers</p></li><li><p>Querying a database using the Firebase SDK</p></li><li><p>Angular Service Layer Design with AngularFire</p></li><li><p>Pagination</p></li><li><p>Indexes, Composite Indexes</p></li><li><p>Data Modification with AngularFire</p></li><li><p>Transactions</p></li><li><p>Multi-path Updates</p></li><li><p>Full CRUD example with AngularFire</p></li><li><p>Authentication with Firebase Authentication</p></li><li><p>Protecting screens with the AngularFire Authentication guard</p></li><li><p>Securing Database access with Firebase Security Rules</p></li><li><p>Full role-based authorization using Firebase Authentication custom claims</p></li><li><p>Secure file upload with Firebase Storage</p></li><li><p>Firebase Storage Rules</p></li><li><p>Server-side image processing with Firebase Cloud Functions</p></li><li><p>Firebase Cloud Functions Database Triggers</p></li><li><p>Firebase Could Functions HTTP endpoints</p></li><li><p>Cloud Functions Service Accounts</p></li><li><p>Production Deployment with Firebase Hosting</p></li></ul><p><strong>What Will You Learn In this Course?</strong></p><p>In this course, you will learn everything that you need to know to become a proficient Firebase developer. You will understand how to model a Firestore database, and how to interact with it using AngularFire.</p><p>You will know how to implement secure, transactional data modification queries straight from the frontend using the AngularFire Observable-based API. You will know how to secure your data using Firestore Security rules, and how to implement role-based Authorization.</p><p>You will learn how to design your system in order for it to need minimum backend code, that when necessary can be implemented using Firebase Cloud Functions.</p><p>At the end of the course, you will feel confident designing and developing applications in a serverless way using the complete Firebase ecosystem.</p><p><strong>Have a look at the course free lessons below, and please enjoy the course!</strong></p>|best, google, latest, proficient, firebase, strong, confident, convenient, firestore, easily

React, also known as React.js, saves time and effort for developers since they only need one programming language. The Native element allows developers to create JavaScript components to design software programs that run on various devices and platforms, such as smartphones, smart TVs, and laptops. With React Native, developers use the same concepts used in the original React framework to design a rich mobile user interface (UI) for various environments from existing components.</p><p><strong>What careers use React Native?</strong></p><p>Businesses that want to create mobile apps for iOS and Android simultaneously to ensure a seamless rollout need developers with a background in React Native. Careers in mobile app development that rely on React Native can count on professionals who can design and build stunning UIs in multiple platforms since it works hand-in-hand with platforms like Windows and tvOS. React Native developers are also vital to helping iOS, and Android companies update and otherwise modernize their apps with features like push notifications and animation for better effectiveness for mobile app subscribers. Developers with a background in React Native might work in full-stack development, designing and refining web-based games, websites, mobile apps, and more.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and Google Flutter?</strong></p><p>Google Flutter offers developers a UI toolkit that has some similarities to React Native. Flutter also has a native component and compiles web, mobile, and desktop applications from a single collection of source codes. Relying on existing code, Flutter is also a free and open-source framework for developers. Until this point, the two frameworks might sound similar. However, React Native is based on and only uses JavaScript, while Flutter only has a loose connection to the language. Google Flutter primarily uses a new language called Dart. Other differences between the two involve sourcing the tool itself and the installation process, setup and configuration, UI component and development, and community support.</p><p><strong>What is Node.Js and what is it used for?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is a server environment built for fast and easily scalable network applications. It was built on Chrome’s JavaScript runtime and uses an event-driven, non-blocking model that makes it the best fit for applications that run on distributed devices and need to run in real-time. By using JavaScript, node.Js can be put to work by many software developers familiar with JavaScript. Because the code is open-source, you can also use it on any platform (Mac OS, Windows, or Linux). Node.js is the architecture for creating websites and real-time applications because it’s easy for teams to learn, and it’s fast. Examples of applications that use node.Js include video conferencing apps, chat servers, eCommerce software, and collaborative online gaming.</p><p><strong>What are the advantages of Node.Js?</strong></p><p>Node.Js is open-source, meaning it’s a free code for all developers. On top of that, it also means that there is a thriving community of Node.Js users and programmers that all add to the knowledge base. Many are happy to share their flavor of the code with other developers, and collectively, the Node.Js environment continues to be enhanced. Because Node.Js uses JavaScript, there is a large pool of developers that understand and can code in the environment. It’s also a relatively simple environment for new team members to learn, making it an efficient choice for development teams with people that need training. Node.Js was developed on Push technology instead of web sockets, which is why it’s the preferred choice for real-time communication applications and programs that need to be highly scalable.</p><p><strong>What does it mean that Node.Js is a runtime system?</strong></p><p>A runtime system is a platform where a software program runs. It’s essentially an environment housing the collection of software and hardware that allows an application to execute (or run). Node.Js is a runtime system because it provides the environment necessary for applications to run within it, and no additional code or hardware is required. Because Node.Js makes use of JavaScript, it’s a runtime system that provides a framework where you can use JavaScript to create and run programs. The JavaScript programming language (which is quite popular) is then automatically translated into machine code for the hardware to run the program in real-time. It’s an efficient system, making it the preferred choice for many software and tech companies.</p><p><strong>What is microservices architecture and how can Node.Js be used for it?</strong></p><p>Microservices architecture is a software development style or method where single-function modules originate. Each has a very well-defined operation and interface and can deploy on its own. In essence, it’s a way of developing modules that you can repurpose from one program or application to another. When you create an application, it’s a collection of modules that have been thoroughly tested and are well-maintained. The modules are typically built around different business-specific capabilities and are then loosely coupled to other modules when deployed as part of a program. You can use Node.Js in microservices architecture as the language of choice for one, some, or all of the microservices (or modules). The beauty of microservices is that you can use the best language for the specific microservice. But where highly scalable, fast programs are needed, Node.Js would be a</p><p><br></p><p><em>If you are wanting to learn how to; build for production, push to production, have a dev and production version, and learn how to navigate the two, this is the class for you!

3480632|A Complete Guide to the JAMstack and React E-Commerce|449|/course/a-complete-guide-to-the-jamstack-and-react-e-commerce/|fullstack|0|4.2|en|Zachary Reece|<p><strong>Get ready to build <em>the most modern,</em> <em>comprehensive, feature-rich, full stack</em> <em>e-commerce platform</em> in any online course! </strong>By the end of this course, <em>you'll be completely confident in building large applications with complex functionality all on your own.</em></p><p>With over <em>75&nbsp;hours </em>of content across more than <em>475 lectures,</em> this is <strong>a</strong> <strong>complete full stack masterclass</strong>! I'll be teaching you everything there is to know about building powerful full stack applications from scratch based on the next-generation JAMstack architecture.</p><p>The JAMstack is <strong>the</strong> <strong>next step in the evolution of web application architecture</strong>. It addresses many of the limitations and frustrations of traditional full stack applications. Unlike a traditional stack, the JAMstack isn't a specific set of certain tools, like MERN. Instead, the JAMstack is <strong>a set of concepts, a philosophy behind how modern full stack applications should be built</strong> to enhance performance, security, and scalability while drastically improving the developer experience. This means <em>better software for our users</em> and <em>easier coding for ourselves.</em></p><p>That means there are a number of different JAMstacks using different sets of tools. For our JAMstack, <strong>we'll be using React with&nbsp;Gatsby, Material-UI, Strapi, Stripe, and Netlify. </strong>We'll use these tools to create a production-ready e-commerce platform that's more comprehensive and full of features than any other online course! <strong>Our project includes everything you can imagine about selling products online</strong> like grouping them into categories, applying custom sorting and filtering, leaving reviews, adding products to a list of favorites, and subscriptions to have products delivered regularly!&nbsp;To enable all of this powerful functionality we'll integrate <strong>a complete authentication system</strong> with <em>login/sign up, forgot/reset password, and social media authentication</em>. This will also include building a user settings page allowing users to change their password as well as any stored shipping or payment information. Then we just need to build our <strong>completely custom cart and checkout process</strong> to let our customers actually make purchases using their credit cards and receive receipts in their email.</p><p>This is a massive project that will guide you through the process of breaking down complex functionality into manageable step-by-step plans of action. You'll learn to think about large-scale projects and how to make architectural decisions that simplify your systems later on. <strong>Even though this course is focused on e-commerce you'll still learn all the underlying concepts that will transfer to every full stack project.</strong></p><p>One of the core principles of the JAMstack is only serving statically generated files. Traditionally in React, like with create-react-app, the server hosting your project sends your JavaScript bundle to be processed and rendered by the client's browser. We'll turn this process around by using the <em>static site generator</em> Gatsby. <strong>Gatsby will take our React code and generate the resulting static HTML files for us</strong> which can be served directly to our users <strong>for lightning-fast performance and increased security. </strong>Gatsby is a very powerful and extensive system with exceptionally helpful features such as programmatic page creation, automatic accessibility enhancements, and powerful image optimization.</p><p>We'll see how <strong>Material-UI can maximize our productive output and reduce complexity for building incredible interfaces with React.</strong> We'll mitigate boilerplate and start working faster by using its <strong>vast component library</strong>, consisting of all the common elements found in most web applications. Then we can bring our designs to life with Material-UI's <strong>styling system</strong> for completely customizing those components and its <strong>theming system</strong> for consolidating the most commonly used styles. Helping us show off our hard work is the <strong>layout system</strong> for consistently arranging our components on the screen. Finally, the <strong>responsive design system</strong> ensures our designs look perfect on the largest screens down to the smallest mobile devices. Material-UI&nbsp;has everything we need to build a stunning frontend with the JAMstack.</p><p><strong>Strapi is the future of backend development</strong>. Strapi is a <em>headless CMS</em> that singlehandedly <strong>revolutionalizes and streamlines all backend processes</strong>. A&nbsp;headless CMS also&nbsp;decouples the backend from the frontend in a JAMstack site which is much more flexible and maintainable. Strapi gives us a very simple user interface for managing our backend content and data, then <strong>automatically creates APIs</strong> <strong>with an integrated JWT-based authentication system</strong> with roles and permissions to interact with that content. In traditional full stack architectures, creating your database models to represent your content, entering all of your data, creating APIs to serve that content, and configuring those APIs with security and authentication were all completely separate tasks that took days, if not weeks to complete. If you haven't ever done full stack or backend development it's hard to truly express the complexity of these tasks! Most full stack courses are going to make you labor through all of these processes manually because there hasn't been another way -- until now!</p><p>Thanks to Strapi all of that tedious and repetitive code will be instantly automated. However, all of <strong>the underlying database models are completely intact and customizable for projects that need more advanced configurations.</strong> Strapi supports most major databases but we'll use MongoDB in this course, although that doesn't make much of a difference thanks to Strapi's abstractions. <strong>Strapi is also open source and built with React</strong> so it's completely customizable and extendable. Strapi is the best headless CMS&nbsp;for the JAMstack!</p><p><strong>Stripe</strong> is one of the leading payment processors for online merchants and <strong>is being used by tech giants like Lyft, Shopify, and Zoom</strong>.&nbsp;Stripe features <strong>one of the most flexible and powerful payment&nbsp;APIs</strong> with extensive and thorough documentation. Using <em>Stripe Elements</em> you can get a secure credit card field set up in seconds, and the <em>Stripe PaymentIntents API</em>&nbsp;powers our completely custom checkout process to finalize the order. Using Stripe enables functionality like <strong>securely saving customer payment information for future use and tracking order history</strong>.</p><p>Once our project is built <strong>we'll deploy it as a live, production website on</strong> <strong>Netlify.</strong> Netlify is without a doubt the best hosting platform for JAMstack sites. Their CEO&nbsp;and co-founder, Mathias Biilmann, actually coined the term! That means <strong>Netlify is specially optimized for JAMstack sites</strong> to deliver cutting-edge performance, security, and scalability by automatically applying our JAMstack best practices like<em> atomic deploys, cache invalidation, using a CDN, and git-based CI/CD.</em></p><p><strong>We will also be covering extra topics like SEO in React, React Hooks, React Context, creating fluid and engaging interfaces with animations, pagination, webhooks, query strings, tabular data, form handling, and so much more!</strong></p><p><strong>The Course Content Includes:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Understanding the motivation and philosophy behind <strong>the next-generation full stack architecture, the JAMstack</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Increasing your opportunities and marketability</strong> in the workplace and getting ahead of the curve by learning the&nbsp;JAMstack</p></li><li><p>Adopting modern&nbsp;React best practices by using <strong>functional components,&nbsp;React Hooks, and the React Context API</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Setting up a new project</strong> with Gatsby,&nbsp;Strapi, and Material-UI</p></li><li><p>Working based on just a <strong>design file</strong> like in an actual work environment</p></li><li><p>Simplifying and automating backend development with <strong>the</strong> <strong>headless CMS&nbsp;Strapi</strong></p></li><li><p>Enhancing performance and security with our <strong>static site generator Gatsby</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Creating a theme</strong> for your application by mastering Material-UI's centralized styling system</p></li><li><p>Learning how to use <strong>responsive design</strong> to ensure your applications look perfect on any screen size!</p></li><li><p>Using the <strong>Material-UI grid system</strong> to align complex layouts perfectly</p></li><li><p>Integrating a <strong>JWT-based authentication</strong> system with login/sign up, forgot/reset password, user settings, and social media integration</p></li><li><p>Building a <strong>completely custom cart and checkout system powered by Stripe</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Saving multiple sets of shipping and payment information</strong> for future usage</p></li><li><p>Breathing life into your applications with <strong>animations from react-lottie and react-spring</strong></p></li><li><p>Refining your <strong>UI/UX</strong> design intuition and seeing concepts in action</p></li><li><p><strong>Programmatically sending emails</strong> for events such as receipts, confirmations, or resetting passwords</p></li><li><p>Automating Search Engine Optimization <strong>(SEO)</strong> <strong>in React applications</strong> using Gatsby plugins</p></li><li><p><strong>Deploying</strong> <strong>a Gatsby frontend to Netlify</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>a Strapi backend</strong> <strong>to AWS</strong> with enhanced server configuration and a custom domain name</p></li><li><p>Powerful <strong>image optimization</strong> techniques like lazy-loading, device-specific sizing, and automatic conversion to next-gen formats</p></li><li><p>Learning about the <strong>MVC model</strong> and how to use it as a mental framework within the JAMstack</p></li></ul><p>Along with <strong>lifetime access to over <em>75 HOURS</em>&nbsp;of content, </strong>you'll also find <strong>easy access to support through active Q/A.</strong></p><p>You've got nothing to lose -- this course comes with a <strong>30-day money-back guarantee </strong>in case you aren't completely satisfied!</p><p><strong>The JAMstack is the future of web development, so</strong> <strong>get ahead of the curve and stand out amongst React developers by learning to build powerful, next-generation full stack applications today.</strong></p>|javascript, shopify, ceo, largest, extensive, massive, modern, complete, revolutionalizes, rich

It can be as simple as making a static text-based website or as elaborate as developing an interactive dynamic website. You can break web development into two different categories: frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side). Frontend code executes on the user's computer. This can include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Backend code runs on the server — this commonly includes communicating with a database and often involves languages like Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP. Web development does not necessarily include the design process — it focuses on code. A web designer builds wireframes to mockup their vision for a website and then shares that with a developer. The developer is responsible for writing the code that implements the design.</p><p><strong>What are the steps to becoming a web developer?</strong></p><p>Some web developers will obtain a degree or certification in the field. However, most jobs don't require a specific degree or level of education, just demonstrated knowledge of the field. So, it is more important that you know how to show off your skills. You could highlight your skills through relevant work experience or a portfolio of past projects. You might also share code you have developed using a platform like GitHub, or participate in solution-based forums like StackOverflow that reward you for helping others. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the first three coding languages you'll need to learn to break into web development. You need these three essential elements to create a modern website and work as a frontend web developer. HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) specifies the content of the website and builds the backbone. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles the content. JavaScript controls the interactive elements of the website.</p><p><strong>How long does it take to become a web developer?</strong></p><p>The answer to this question will depend on you. The more time you spend developing your skills, the faster you can become a web developer. The good news is that web development generally uses light-weight code that is easier to learn than many other languages. If dedicated, you can learn the basics of web development in a couple of months. But good web developers never stop learning. A better question might be, What can I do to become a better web developer faster? The answer to this question is practice. Becoming familiar with coding helps tremendously, but there is also a less obvious benefit of practicing. The more you code, the more you will run into problems or find bugs in your code. A significant aspect of web development is solving problems and debugging code. The better you get at solving problems and tracking down bugs, the faster you will get at coding.</p><p><strong>What is React?</strong></p><p>React is a front-end library in Javascript that was developed by Facebook. The simplest definition of React is that it is a user interface library used for building UI components for the web. But if that was all React did, it would be little more than a template library. Developers define components in React by using an HTML-like syntax called JSX. These encapsulated components manage their own state, making it simple to pass rich data to a component and keep the state of the application and its components out of the Document Object Model (DOM). These features give React components the ability to react dynamically and efficiently to changes in their state. A set of simple components in React can be composed into either simple single-page applications or large, complex web applications.</p><p><strong>What is React used for?</strong></p><p>React is an open-source JavaScript frontend library. Some developers consider it a frontend framework because it does more than standard libraries usually do. The most common use of React is to build dynamic user interfaces for single-page web applications. But the structure of React makes it useful for more than just creating websites. JSX, which is one feature of React, is a syntax extension for Javascript that provides a template for the HTML and manages the state of the element. But JSX can be used as an interface for things other than HTML. React Native uses React to build mobile applications. Here, JSX becomes an interface for mobile UIs instead of HTML. There are even a few libraries that use React and JSX to interact with and manage hardware like React Hardware.</p><p><strong>How does React work?</strong></p><p>React encourages engineers to write code using a Functional Programming approach. Engineers create components, which are normal Javascript functions. These functions return information to tell React what content should be displayed on the screen. The real power of React comes from the ability to nest or compose these functions inside of one another. This nesting ability encourages code reuse and allows an engineer to write a component a single time, but in many different places.</p><p><strong>Is React a framework or library?</strong></p><p>Frameworks provide an opinionated approach to building an entire application. Libraries, on the other hand, assist in building a single aspect of an application. With this in mind, React is a library. It assists engineers in presenting HTML in the browser. React has no opinions on how data is fetched, how styling is applied, or how the app is deployed or built.</p><p><strong>Is React worth learning?</strong></p><p>Yes, React is worth learning. There are a couple of reasons. The first one is that React is in high demand in the software development job market and has been for a few years. If you learn to code in React and can do it well, you will increase your chances of finding a job. This alone is another reason it is worth learning. Website users no longer will settle for old-fashioned sites that won't update without a page reload. React’s method of dynamically updating the HTML of a web page fits these users' needs and improves their experience. React has also been around a few years and has stood the test of time. A large portion of websites, both small and large, use React as a frontend framework.</p><p><strong>Is React hard to learn?</strong></p><p>Every technology or programming language has a learning curve, and React is no different. But it is easy to learn if you are dedicated and determined to create frontend web applications. To make learning React simpler, you should stick to the basics of React before you add any extra libraries, as that will only complicate your learning experience in the beginning. Since React is a Javascript framework, a solid grounding in Javascript will give you a head start. With this knowledge, the unique concept of JSX, React's templating language, and the way React uses state will be much easier to grasp.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and ReactJS, and which one should I learn?</strong></p><p>React, or React.JS, is a front-end Javascript library for building UI components for the web. If you are interested in web development, React is the perfect library to learn to create interactive, dynamic single-page apps, or even full-scale web applications. React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications for both the Android phone and Apple's iPhone. React Native is still React, which means the syntax and workflow for building applications are basically the same, but the generated components are different. In React, web components are generated. In React Native, the generated components interact with a phone's native APIs. If your focus is web development, then you should learn React. If you want to build mobile applications, it is best to learn React first and become familiar with the technology before you try React Native.</p><p><strong>Why is React so popular?</strong></p><p>There are many reasons why React is popular. One reason is that Facebook developed it. The social proof is that if it is good enough for Facebook, one of the most popular social networks on the web, it should be good enough for other applications. React also solved many of the past issues that developers had with developing single-page applications (SPAs). React came out when SPAs were becoming popular, and all the existing frameworks to build them made development complicated and prone to bugs. One feature that makes it better than past libraries is that React is relatively easy to use. Its components are reusable, plus React's use of the virtual DOM makes it very performant. React should remain popular in the future as each new release brings new features and performance improvements.</p><p><strong>What is React Native?</strong></p><p>Created by Facebook, React Native is an open-source-based mobile application framework that uses only JavaScript, making it capable of supporting both Android and iOS platforms. React, also known as React.js, saves time and effort for developers since they only need one programming language. The Native element allows developers to create JavaScript components to design software programs that run on various devices and platforms, such as smartphones, smart TVs, and laptops. With React Native, developers use the same concepts used in the original React framework to design a rich mobile user interface (UI) for various environments from existing components.</p><p><strong>What careers use React Native?</strong></p><p>Businesses that want to create mobile apps for iOS and Android simultaneously to ensure a seamless rollout need developers with a background in React Native. Careers in mobile app development that rely on React Native can count on professionals who can design and build stunning UIs in multiple platforms since it works hand-in-hand with platforms like Windows and tvOS. React Native developers are also vital to helping iOS, and Android companies update and otherwise modernize their apps with features like push notifications and animation for better effectiveness for mobile app subscribers. Developers with a background in React Native might work in full-stack development, designing and refining web-based games, websites, mobile apps, and more.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between React Native and Google Flutter?</strong></p><p>Google Flutter offers developers a UI toolkit that has some similarities to React Native. Flutter also has a native component and compiles web, mobile, and desktop applications from a single collection of source codes. Relying on existing code, Flutter is also a free and open-source framework for developers. Until this point, the two frameworks might sound similar. However, React Native is based on and only uses JavaScript, while Flutter only has a loose connection to the language. Google Flutter primarily uses a new language called Dart. Other differences between the two involve sourcing the tool itself and the installation process, setup and configuration, UI component and development, and community support.</p><p><strong>Video and Audio Production Quality</strong></p><p>All our videos are created/produced as <strong>high-quality video and audio</strong> to provide you the best learning experience. </p><p>You will be,</p><ul><li><p>Seeing clearly</p></li><li><p>Hearing clearly</p></li><li><p>Moving through the course without distractions<br></p></li></ul><p><strong> You'll also get:</strong></p><p>Lifetime Access to The Course</p><p>Fast &amp; Friendly Support in the Q&amp;A section</p><p>Udemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download</p><p>Dive in now to our <strong>Complete React Native Course with Router, Hooks and Context </strong>course</p><p>We offer&nbsp;<strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions.</p><p>See you in the course!</p>|popular, browser, developers, iphone, google, apps, innovations, updating, modernize, javascript

Over the past two decades, I have worked in the cybersecurity and information technology realm, fighting for my projects to be funded. Early in my career, I didn't <strong>understand why certain projects would be funded and executed</strong>, while others wouldn't. What I learned, is that it all came down to<strong> Risk Management</strong> by our executives and managers.</p><p>You will learn the terms used by executives and&nbsp;managers in discussing&nbsp;Risk Management, and how to apply the concepts of Risk Management to your networks, systems, and projects. This course is not an operational or tactical&nbsp;course that focuses on how you will secure your networks, but instead<strong> focuses on the mindset of managers and teaches you how to think like they do</strong>. Once you master these concepts, it is much easier to <strong>build your business case for your projects</strong> and justify your budgetary needs.</p><p>Throughout this course, we will discuss what comprises Risk (assets, threats, and vulnerabilities), providing <strong>numerous real-world examples</strong> along the way. We will also cover Qualitative and Quantitative Risk Measurements, showing how you can calculate the risk of an uncertainty due to vulnerabilities and threats.</p><p>This course also includes<strong> two case studies </strong>of what happens when risk management fails, as demonstrated by the Amazon Web Services outage and Equifax data breach that both occurred&nbsp;in 2017.

The world is becoming increasingly interconnected and complex. Countries and regions previously considered relatively peaceful are experiencing a new risk picture. Security Risk Management is the ongoing process of identifying these security risks and implementing plans to address them. Risk is determined by considering the likelihood that known threats will exploit vulnerabilities and the impact they have on valuable assets. The essence of our work as security professionals is our understanding of two key terms: security and risk. Since security is what we are charged with providing to our organizations, it is a good idea to spend some time defining this and related terms. A good way to understand key terms in a broader societal context is to explore the laws and crimes around them, together with the concomitant tradeoffs that we must make lest we sacrifice privacy in the name of crime fighting. We will cover many of the disciplines that are necessary for organizations to practice security in a holistic manner. Each organization must develop an enterprise wide security program that consists of technologies, procedures, and processes covered throughout this course. </p><p>In this practical course, you'll learn: </p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>Learning security governance and compliance</p></li><li><p>Learning legal and regulatory issues</p></li><li><p>Professional ethics &amp; Personnel security policies</p></li><li><p>Risk management &amp; Threat modeling</p></li></ul>|professionals, crimes, learning, modeling, crime, technologies, holistic, security, masterclass, cybersecurity

4783692|NIST Cybersecurity A-Z: NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)|1099|/course/nist-csf/|cybersecurity|0|4.3|en|Martin Yanev|<p>This course will teach you how to use the&nbsp; NIST Cybersecurity Framework that provides a process that integrates security, privacy, and cyber supply chain risk management activities into the system development life cycle. The risk-based approach to control selection and specification considers <strong>effectiveness</strong>, <strong>efficiency</strong>, and <strong>constraints</strong> due to applicable laws, <strong>directives</strong>, <strong>Executive Orders</strong>, <strong>policies</strong>, <strong>standards</strong>, or <strong>regulations</strong>. Managing organizational risk is paramount to effective information security and privacy programs; the CSF approach can be applied to new and legacy systems, any type of system or technology (e.g., IoT, control systems), and within any type of organization regardless of size or sector.</p><p><br></p><p>NIST premised the entire Framework on the concept of risk management, which is “the ongoing process of identifying, assessing, and responding to risk,” an approach that provides a dynamic implementation of the Framework’s recommendations. The Framework consists of three parts: <strong>The Framework Core</strong>, the <strong>Framework Implementation</strong>, and the <strong>Framework Profile Tiers</strong>. The purpose of these three parts is to provide a “common language” that all organizations can use to understand, manage, and communicate their cybersecurity initiatives, both internally and externally, and can scale down or up to various parts of an organization as needed.</p><p><br></p><p>The Framework Core is a set of activities aimed at organizing cybersecurity initiatives to achieve specific outcomes. The Core has five functions: <strong>Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, </strong>and<strong> Recover.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 2</strong>: Cybersecurity Risk Planning and Management: </p><p>This section discusses how to establish knowledge of the systems in place and how to inform management of those systems’ risk profiles. We will also discuss how to develop plans for dealing with the highest priority risks. The goal is to help the students to develop an understanding necessary to manage cybersecurity risk to systems, assets, data, and capabilities.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 3:</strong> User and Network Infrastructure Planning and Management:</p><p>This section provides a series of steps and tools to improve their organizations’ network infrastructure protection through improved asset access control, awareness and training, data security, protection policies, maintenance procedures, and automated protection processes.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 4:</strong> Tools and Techniques for Detecting Cyber Incidents</p><p>This section aims to help the students describe effective techniques for detecting cyber incidents or attacks, establish best approaches for monitoring systems to detect incidents, and plan for the development of organizational processes for detecting incidents.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 5:</strong> Developing a Continuity of Operations Plan</p><p>This section will provide the reader with fundamental concepts and practical steps to respond to and recover from a cybersecurity incident. By the end of this section, the student will grasp the concepts necessary to develop an incident response plan (IRP), maintaining communications within the response team and the broader organization throughout an incident. The section will introduce the reader to the basic concepts of how to contain and mitigate an incident. Finally, the section will introduce the student to the basic principles and elements of developing a recovery plan and the importance of lessons learned in the aftermath of a cybersecurity incident.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 6: </strong>Supply Chain Risk Management</p><p>This section will provide the student with an introduction to the complex and evolving supply chain risk management field. The student will also learn about the five essential aspects of supply chain risk management in the most recently updated version of the NIST Framework: (1) how to identify where you should manage supply chain risks, (2) pinpointing which suppliers are crucial to supply chain risk management, (3) developing vendor contracts that minimize supply chain risks, (4) continually assessing supply chain risk management procedures, and (5) testing to make sure vendors are resilient in the event of supply disruptions.</p><p><br></p><p>You are going the get the ultimate learning experience as every section is followed by practice test and has reading resources uploaded.</p>|planning, organizing, technology, testing, cyber, lessons, teach, learning, cybersecurity, training

If you don’t have experience with Python or you are totally new, we will <strong>start with the basics of Python</strong>. Before starting Django we will simply comprehend Python Package Managing ( PIP ) tools and virtual environments. Finally, we are going to start Django models, databases, URLs, views, migrations, authentication, cache, and so on</p><p>Consider the devices that you use to access the internet on a daily basis. You’ll notice that there isn’t a standard screen size. Without CSS, rendering a website’s text, layout, and design for these discrepancies in screens would be impossible. CSS is the backbone of all website styling work, and is rightfully considered a cornerstone of internet technology.</p><p><strong>Django</strong> is an excellent framework for new web developers and efficiency-minded veterans alike. Udemy Django courses cover all aspects of Django development, whether you’re interested in using the framework by itself, or adding it to your full stack development practice.</p><p><strong>HTML</strong>, or hypertext markup language, is computer code used to create web pages and emails. Web developers, email marketers, web writers, and many others use HTML.</p><p>The world of <strong>web development</strong> is as wide as the internet itself. Much of our social and vocational lives play out on the internet, which prompts new industries aimed at creating, managing, and debugging the websites and applications that we increasingly rely on.</p><p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, which is the biggest markup language used to display web pages on the Internet. In other words, web pages are composed of HTML, which is used to display text, images, or other resources through a web browser.</p><p>HTML is the basic building block of the web and actually isn’t a technical programming language. It is responsible for the structure of the website. </p><p><strong>Django</strong> is an interesting framework for developers because it provides the infrastructure required for database-driven websites that have user authentication, content administration, contact forms and more. Instead of creating all of these features from scratch, you can use the Django framework that is already built so you can focus your time on developing your web app instead.</p><p>In this course, we will start with HTML, which is the basis of web development and then we will continue to learn CSS.</p><p>This course will take you<strong> from a beginner to a more experienced level. </strong>You will learn <strong>HTML5 and CSS3</strong> step by step with <strong>hands-on</strong> examples.</p><p><strong>In this course you will learn;</strong></p><ul><li><p>To create static HTML sites,</p></li><li><p>To create a beautiful, responsive landing page for anyone,</p></li><li><p>You will learn to use basic tags which are used commonly,</p></li><li><p>You will be able to prepare lists in different formats,</p></li><li><p>The difference in usage between block-level and inline elements in HTML,</p></li><li><p>The uses of HTML table, and by learning this you will be able to create different designs of your own,</p></li><li><p>To able to create commonly used user login and registration pages by learning the form structure,</p></li><li><p>And improve your knowledge step by step by learning the basics of CSS</p></li><li><p>To place pages in the easiest way by talking about all layout models in CSS.</p></li><li><p>To prepare web pages with Grid CSS and Flexbox features.</p></li><li><p>Learn modeling your domain and code classes with Django</p></li><li><p>Basic Commands for Mac</p></li><li><p>Understand Django basics like Models, HTTP, Processes</p></li><li><p>Learn how to do Django Migrations with codes</p></li></ul><p><strong>What is web development?</strong></p><p>Web development is a broad description of the tasks and technologies that go into creating a website. It can be as simple as making a static text-based website or as elaborate as developing an interactive dynamic website. You can break web development into two different categories: frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side). Frontend code executes on the user's computer. This can include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Backend code runs on the server — this commonly includes communicating with a database and often involves languages like Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP. Web development does not necessarily include the design process — it focuses on code. A web designer builds wireframes to mockup their vision for a website and then shares that with a developer. The developer is responsible for writing the code that implements the design.</p><p><strong>What are the steps to becoming a web developer?</strong></p><p>Some web developers will obtain a degree or certification in the field. However, most jobs don't require a specific degree or level of education, just demonstrated knowledge of the field. So, it is more important that you know how to show off your skills. You could highlight your skills through relevant work experience or a portfolio of past projects. You might also share code you have developed using a platform like GitHub, or participate in solution-based forums like StackOverflow that reward you for helping others. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the first three coding languages you'll need to learn to break into web development. You need these three essential elements to create a modern website and work as a frontend web developer. HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) specifies the content of the website and builds the backbone. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles the content. JavaScript controls the interactive elements of the website.</p><p><strong>How long does it take to become a web developer?</strong></p><p>The answer to this question will depend on you. The more time you spend developing your skills, the faster you can become a web developer. The good news is that web development generally uses light-weight code that is easier to learn than many other languages. If dedicated, you can learn the basics of web development in a couple of months. But good web developers never stop learning. A better question might be, What can I do to become a better web developer faster? The answer to this question is practice. Becoming familiar with coding helps tremendously, but there is also a less obvious benefit of practicing. The more you code, the more you will run into problems or find bugs in your code. A significant aspect of web development is solving problems and debugging code. The better you get at solving problems and tracking down bugs, the faster you will get at coding.</p><p><strong>What are the most popular coding languages for web development?</strong></p><p>The must-know languages for frontend web development are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These languages are used by nearly every site you visit. JavaScript is a fundamental programming language for adding interactivity to your website. There are many popular JavaScript libraries that you can import and allow you to add useful functionality while dramatically decreasing the amount of code you might write, and offering features that would be difficult or time-consuming to code yourself. Once you are comfortable with JavaScript, you will want to explore the many libraries available. There are many other programming languages that you can use for web development. If you want to write backend code, you will need to learn a language that runs on the server that powers your website (as opposed to the web browser, where frontend code is executed). Consider learning Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP. It can be helpful to research which backend language is popular in the field that interests you most.</p><p><strong>What are the skills I need to become a web developer?</strong></p><p>You'll need to be able to code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Mastering these three languages is essential for web development. They each serve a crucial function: HTML is the content itself – the words, pictures, etc., CSS controls how all of that content looks, and JavaScript makes a website interactive. Luckily, you can learn all three languages on your own using online tools and courses. To be a good web developer, you'll also need many skills beyond programming languages. A crucial professional skill is problem-solving. Good problem-solving skills will help you to track down bugs quickly and develop algorithms to complete complex tasks. Interpersonal skills are also necessary for the job, such as communication and collaboration. Many web development projects require a team of developers. To succeed in web development, you must work well in team environments.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between front-end, back-end, and full-stack web development?</strong></p><p>Frontend web developers write client-side code. This is all the code that runs on the user's computer when they visit a website. Generally, this includes everything that the user can see. To write frontend code, you need to know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Backend web developers write server-side code. This is all the code that runs on the website's server. Backend code controls the logic of the website. For example, a frontend developer may code where a username will appear on a website and its style, but the backend developer will write the code that retrieves the username from the database. Backend developers need to know a server-side programming language in addition to HTML and JavaScript. Not all projects have a front and backend web developer. Some projects only have full-stack web developers, which do both front and backend coding. The team composition depends on the needs of the project. Full-stack web developers need to be strong front and backend coders.</p><p><strong>What is Python?</strong></p><p>Python is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Whether you work in artificial intelligence or finance or are pursuing a career in web development or data science, Python is one of the most important skills you can learn. Python's simple syntax is especially suited for desktop, web, and business applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and usability. Python was developed on the premise that there should be only one way (and preferably, one obvious way) to do things, a philosophy that resulted in a strict level of code standardization. The core programming language is quite small and the standard library is also large. In fact, Python's large library is one of its greatest benefits, providing different tools for programmers suited for a variety of tasks.</p><p><strong>Python vs. R: what is the Difference?</strong></p><p>Python and R are two of today's most popular programming tools. When deciding between Python and R, you need to think about your specific needs. On one hand, Python is relatively easy for beginners to learn, is applicable across many disciplines, has a strict syntax that will help you become a better coder, and is fast to process large datasets. On the other hand, R has over 10,000 packages for data manipulation, is capable of easily making publication-quality graphics, boasts superior capability for statistical modeling, and is more widely used in academia, healthcare, and finance.</p><p><strong>What does it mean that Python is object-oriented?</strong></p><p>Python is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports many programming approaches. Along with procedural and functional programming styles, Python also supports the object-oriented style of programming. In object-oriented programming, a developer completes a programming project by creating Python objects in code that represent objects in the actual world. These objects can contain both the data and functionality of the real-world object. To generate an object in Python you need a class. You can think of a class as a template. You create the template once, and then use the template to create as many objects as you need. Python classes have attributes to represent data and methods that add functionality. A class representing a car may have attributes like color, speed, and seats and methods like driving, steering, and stopping. The concept of combining data with functionality in an object is called encapsulation, a core concept in the object-oriented programming paradigm.</p><p><strong>What are the limitations of Python?</strong></p><p>Python is a widely used, general-purpose programming language, but it has some limitations. Because Python is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, it is slow compared to a compiled, statically typed language like C. Therefore, Python is useful when speed is not that important. Python's dynamic type system also makes it use more memory than some other programming languages, so it is not suited to memory-intensive applications. The Python virtual engine that runs Python code runs single-threaded, making concurrency another limitation of the programming language. Though Python is popular for some types of game development, its higher memory and CPU usage limits its usage for high-quality 3D game development. That being said, computer hardware is getting better and better, and the speed and memory limitations of Python are getting less and less relevant making Python even more popular.</p><p><strong>How is Python used?</strong></p><p>Python is a general programming language used widely across many industries and platforms. One common use of Python is scripting, which means automating tasks in the background. Many of the scripts that ship with Linux operating systems are Python scripts. Python is also a popular language for machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, and data science because its simple syntax makes it easy to quickly build real applications. You can use Python to create desktop applications. Many developers use it to write Linux desktop applications, and it is also an excellent choice for web and game development. Python web frameworks like Flask and Django are a popular choice for developing web applications. Recently, Python is also being used as a language for mobile development via the Kivy third-party library, although there are currently some drawbacks Python needs to overcome when it comes to mobile development.</p><p><strong>What is Django?</strong></p><p>Django is a Python-based Web Application Framework that follows the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern. As one of the most popular Web Application Frameworks available today, Django has an extensive amount of documentation and extensions available. It is also built primarily for data-driven websites. A non-profit organization and an active community of developers contribute to Django’s platform, which is both open-source and free. The advantages of using Django are rapid development and less code. Django also provides an administrative interface and many bundled components. Websites such as The Washington Times, Instagram, and Nextdoor used Django for development, and employers frequently seek Django developers and Python specialists for web development.</p><p><strong>Who uses Django?</strong></p><p>Python programmers who are interested in a low code development prefer Django for its “don’t repeat yourself” model. Ideally, Django can create streamlined programs that require little coding to initialize. It has a significant body of architecture within its components and libraries, and you can administer it internally. Developers primarily use Django for web applications that need to balance large amounts of data and significant loads. Over 2,500 packages are available to extend Django’s behavior, making it a particularly robust platform. Developers interested in using Django can check to see if the functionality they desire already exists. Django is also often favored by full-stack developers who want to be able to build web applications from start to finish, as you can use it for both frontend and backend design.</p><p><strong>Is Django frontend or backend?</strong></p><p>Frontend design is related to what the user sees and interacts with. Backend is concerned primarily with the data. Django is both a frontend and backend Web Application Framework, unlike platforms like JavaScript’s Bootstrap, which you can use for frontend design. Django concerns itself primarily with the application’s interior workings, such as data manipulation, but is also useful for end-to-end frontend and backend design. A developer familiar with Django may be able to develop their web application “full-stack,” developing the entirety of the web application from front to back. However, frontend and backend work in Django can be separated if desired, meaning you can use Django for one or the other with some work. When separated in this way, Django is compatible with other frontend or backend technology.</p><p><strong>What are the key considerations when deciding on a Web Application Framework?</strong></p><p>There are both open-source, free Web Application Frameworks and commercial, proprietary frameworks. The latter is more expensive, but it will generally come with more support. Web Application Frameworks usually focus on a specific language. Django works with Python. Additionally, every Web Application Framework has its own level of complexity and learning curve, documentation, and support. Most web developers will want a Web Application Framework in a language they are fluent in. A solid library of extensions and plug-ins is also ideal as it reduces the amount of work the developer will need to do. Since the Web Application Framework has a lot to do with how a system functions, the system's look-and-feel may also come into play, as may other quality of life issues such as the robustness of the administrative panel.</p><p><strong>What is the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern?</strong></p><p>The Model-View-Controller architectural pattern (MVC) is a type of software pattern for creating user interfaces. It standardizes how information flows through an application and makes it easier for developers to control all levels, from frontend to backend. Many Web Application Frameworks today follow the MVC model. Under the MVC architecture, the “model” refers to the data. The “view” refers to the display. Finally, the “controller” refers to the way that both models and views are updated. By retaining this consistency, multiple developers can also work together (both frontend and backend) without potentially retreading ground or overwriting essential items. The MVC model makes it easier to manage interconnected elements while ensuring that the application functions as a whole. MVC is compatible with desktop, mobile, and web application designs.</p><p><strong>What is HTML and why is it important?</strong></p><p>HTML stands for hyper-text markup language. Whether on a mobile device or a computer, every website that you browse is designed with HTML. HTML isn’t a “programming language,” but rather a “formatting language.” It tells a browser how to display text, images, and other media elements. When HTML was first developed, it was fairly simple. For example, the text on a page could be bolded, italicized, or underlined, and images could be resized and aligned. Today, HTML is much more complex and dynamic, allowing front-end developers to create any layout or setup they desire.</p><p><strong>Why is CSS and Javascript important for HTML?</strong></p><p>HTML is a formatting language, not a programming language. Javascript is often necessary to make HTML “dynamic.” While HTML can make it so that text is displayed on the screen, Javascript can update this text or make it move. Javascript is used for both front-end and back-end development, hand-in-hand with HTML, to create complex and attractive web designs. Meanwhile, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are used to organize the look and feel of a website and make the website easier to update and manipulate. Today, HTML, CSS, and Javascript are frequently used to develop responsive web designs — designs that react to a user’s environment for a better user experience.</p><p><strong>What is an HTML element and why is it important?</strong></p><p>HTML is designed on a modular basis, meaning every part of the web page has a specific “place.” An HTML element is a part of the page. Common HTML elements include “&lt;p&gt;” for a “paragraph” and “&lt;title&gt;” for the “title” of the page. In fact, the entirety of the HTML page is within the “&lt;html&gt;” element. Elements are begun and ended with tags, so a title would be written: “&lt;title&gt;This is the Title to the page.&lt;/title&gt;” Organizing code this way makes it easier to reference and control. Each element may also have characteristics. For instance, the “&lt;p&gt;” (paragraph) tag can be aligned in a certain direction. These are the basic building blocks of HTML and what most designers should learn first.</p><p><strong>What is Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)?</strong></p><p>CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used to style markup language. Markup languages include HTML, XHML, XML, and other XML-based languages. The most common use of CSS is to style HTML web pages. Although HTML doesn't need CSS to function, every web page would look the same without it. With CSS, you can target specific elements in a web page and change the look and arrangement on the page. CSS can make an embedded image small or cover the entire webpage as a background. You can enlarge a heading and apply a specific font to stand out from the rest of the page. Other things you can do with CSS include changing the color of elements, making elements float to one side of the page, and the list goes on. Every web page uses HTML, and every web page that has its unique look uses CSS.</p><p><strong>What careers use CSS?</strong></p><p>CSS applies to any career that involves web development. Web designers create the templates, mockups, and styles for a website using HTML and CSS that web developers use to build websites. Front-end web developers use CSS with HTML and JavaScript to build front-end web applications that run in the browser. Fullstack web developers create both the part of a web application that runs in the browser and on the server and need to know CSS to make the front-end look good. Content managers may need to know CSS to apply custom styles to articles they publish through a content management system like WordPress. Other job titles that may require you to know CSS include junior web developer, social media manager, website editor, content editor, website project manager, website support specialist, and webmaster.</p><p><strong>Why would you want to take this course?</strong>&nbsp; </p><p>Our answer is simple: The quality of teaching. </p><p>When you enroll, you will feel the OAK Academy`s seasoned instructors' expertise.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>Video and Audio Production Quality</strong></p><p>All our videos are created/produced as <strong>high-quality video and audio</strong> to provide you the best learning experience. </p><p>You will be,</p><ul><li><p>Seeing clearly</p></li><li><p>Hearing clearly</p></li><li><p>Moving through the course without distractions</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong> You'll also get:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Lifetime Access to The Course</p></li><li><p>Fast &amp; Friendly Support in the Q&amp;A section</p></li><li><p>Udemy Certificate of Completion Ready for Download</p></li></ul><p>Dive in now <strong>HTML, CSS &amp; Python Django for the Full Stack Web Development </strong>course.</p><p>We offer&nbsp;<strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions.</p><p>See you in the course!</p>|stackoverflow, browser, java, php, html, webmaster, html5, django, javascript, python

However, during this course and after many hours of exciting hands-on practices on the different offensive and defensive security methods you will become a Linux expert at the level of a cybersecurity expert. You will learn Kali Linux and Parrot OS as the main Linux distros used in this course.</p><p><br></p><p>######################################################################<br>######################################################################</p><p><strong>Here is an overview of the main content of the course:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Sections 1 to 3</strong> are for introduction and preparation. Here you set up your offensive lab and will learn the basics of Linux to get prepared for the ethical hacking sections. You will also install Kali Linux and Microsoft Visual Studio Code as your main IDE (Integrated development environment). Then you move on to create your vulnerable labs such as dvwa, bwapp, webgoat, and so on. Also, you will do your first capture-the-flag (CTF) and create your HTB (HackTheBox dot com) account if you haven't before.<br></p></li><li><p>You will start your professional white hat hacking training from <strong>sections 4 to 10</strong>. Here you will learn a broad range of hacking tools, attack vectors, technics, and procedures. They start from Reconnaissance, enumeration, vulnerability scanning to exploitation, post-exploitation, password cracking. You will continue with network attacks (wired and wireless), social engineering attacks, Web applications attacks (OWASP Top 10), and much more.<br></p></li><li><p>You'll take your second crash course in Python in <strong>section 11</strong>. Here you learn Python geared towards IT Security and Hacking purposes.<br></p></li><li><p>Now you have earned all the requirements, a professional hacker needs in the pentesting battlefield. In <strong>section 12</strong>, you get to know the interesting world of CTFs (Capture the Flags), especially on HackTheBox dot com and will hack 8 machines:<br>3 Easy machines: BLUE, DEVEL, NETMON<br>4 Medium: SNIPER, MANGO, BLUNDER, POPCORN<br>1 Hard: CONTROL<br>By the end of this section, you are an ethical hacker who feels incredibly confident with penetration testing in different hacking scenarios.<br></p></li><li><p>Everything is standardized in modern times. Giving a break to practical hacking, in <strong>section 13</strong> you will learn the must-know security standards such as MITRE, OWASP, PTES, OSSTMM and their terminologies as well as methodologies in the IT Security field.<br></p></li><li><p>We did everything up to here to be a great Red Teamer, here you learn how to use all that practical ethical hacking techniques along with MITRE ATT&amp;CK Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures to conduct a comprehensive Red Teaming assessment on your customers. In <strong>section 14</strong> you will learn how to work based on various MITRE TTPs with a powerful Red Teaming Framework. You will also learn how to customize your C2 to be like what you want and also learn how to do various operations with it.<br></p></li><li><p>More than half of today's APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats) are experts on active directory attacks and you as an ethical hacker or Red Teamer should also know how to do that and report vulnerabilities to your customers. In <strong>section 15 </strong>you will learn how to configure AD, create a vulnerable AD lab and perform some of the most important attacks in this category. Having this category of attacks in a separated section is because of the importance and amount of common attacks by APTs on this module in the victim’s environment.<br></p></li><li><p>In <strong>section 16 </strong>we tried to cover every tactic, its corresponding technique, and also the procedures behind it standardized by MITRE ATT&amp;CK all in one. We will study most of the operations done by threat actors and APTs. Their TTPs are covered line by line and in near future, with some updates, we are going to practice every technique after its explanations. Also, most of these TTPs are covered during the course without knowing what category of TTPs it is. It is really important to stick to MITRE ATT&amp;CK and that’s why we put a small section on it.<br></p></li><li><p>Up to <strong>section 17</strong>, you finished your pythonic offensive security with all possible aspects. Now you are a professional and ethical hacker. From this section on, you start your defensive security journey, where the focus is mainly on defense against offensive technics and tactics you've learned up until here. In this section, you learn terminologies and methodologies such as Defense in Depth on the defensive side, where the SIEM tool is in the center of attention.<br></p></li><li><p>In <strong>section 18</strong> you start building up your fully customized Linux-based and 100% open source SIEM tool using Elastic-Stack and Wazuh Manager (The Open Source Security Platform). In this section, you set up Wazuh Manager Server, Open Distro for Elasticsearch, Filebeat, and Kibana.<br></p></li><li><p>Then in <strong>section 19,</strong> you move on to endpoints such as Windows and Linux Servers, Windows 10, and Fortigate firewall appliance, to integrate these different log sources into your ELK-Stack SIEM server. Also, you will learn how you can roll out authenticated Wazuh agents on a network of Windows machines using Domain GPOs in an automated form.<br></p></li><li><p><strong>Section 20</strong> covers index management in Elasticsearch where the life cycle of the indexes will be managed. In this lecture, you will learn how to manage your accumulated alerts in your Elastic Stack to improve your server disks and storage.<br></p></li><li><p>In <strong>section 21</strong> you will extend your configured SIEM with its capabilities such as File Integrity Monitoring (FIM), Linux Syscalls monitoring, Enterprise continuous vulnerability monitoring, CIS Hardening Benchmarks (SCA), Windows Defender, and Sysinternals Sysmon Eventchannel.<br></p></li><li><p>How one can create new alerts out of ingested logs in Wazuh Manager is the topic of <strong>section 22</strong>. In this section, you will learn how decoders and rules are constructed behind the scenes and how you can create your own custom decoders and rules for your own requirements.<br></p></li><li><p>And finally, you will finish this course with hunting IoCs (threat hunting) in your fully customized SIEM. In <strong>section 23</strong>, you will run some of the attacks you have learned during the course such as Mimikatz, HTA, Brute Force, etc. from your Cobalt Strike on your Parrot OS against your endpoints (Wazuh agents) and you will examine generated alerts for these specific security events.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><strong><em>Disclaimer:</em></strong></p><ul><li><p><em>This course is created </em><strong><em>for educational purposes only</em></strong><em>, all the attacks are launched in our own lab or against online Lab systems that are legally permitted to run tests against them.</em></p></li><li><p><em>This course is totally a product of the two instructors of this course and no other organization is associated with it.

4732974|NIST Cybersecurity A-Z: NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)|1099|/course/cybersecurity-framework/|cybersecurity|0|4.1|en|Martin Yanev|<p>The <strong>NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)</strong> provides a comprehensive, flexible, repeatable, and measurable<strong> 7-step process </strong>that any organization can use to manage information security and privacy risk for organizations and systems and links to a suite of <strong>NIST standards and guidelines</strong> to support implementation of risk management programs to meet the requirements of the<strong> Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA).</strong></p><p><br></p><ul><li><p><strong>Prepare </strong>essential activities to <strong>prepare</strong> the organization to manage security and privacy risks</p></li><li><p><strong>Categorize</strong> the system and information processed, stored, and transmitted based on an impact analysis</p></li><li><p><strong>Select </strong>the set of NIST SP 800-53 controls to protect the system based on risk assessment(s)</p></li><li><p><strong>Implement</strong> the controls and document how controls are deployed</p></li><li><p><strong>Assess</strong> to determine if the controls are in place, operating as intended, and producing the desired results</p></li><li><p><strong>Authorize</strong> senior official makes a risk-based decision to <strong>authorize</strong> the system (to operate)</p></li><li><p><strong>Continuously monitor </strong>control implementation and risks to the system</p></li></ul><p>This course will give you comprehensive understanding of the risk management process for <strong>all organizations</strong>. Therefore, the NIST RMF is also potentially applicable to risk management in all corporate settings. This course is a comprehensive explication of the topic of risk management and it will allow a person to <strong>understand the application and uses of the RMF </strong>content. The people who would benefit from this knowledge range from managers to all types of technical workers and specialists.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 2</strong>: <strong><em>Introduction to Organizational Security Risk Management</em></strong></p><p>This section presents an overview of organizational risk management through an exploration of the types of organizational risks that senior leaders must identify, the necessity and benefits of managing those risks, and the information security regulation that senior leaders must consider as they manage risk.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 3</strong>: <strong><em>Survey of Existing Risk Management Models</em></strong></p><p>This section discuss various models that can be used to implement the NIST RMF. The goal is to provide a comparative assessment of existing models and demonstrate how the NIST framework sets itself apart from other models.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 4:</strong> <strong><em>Categorize Information and Information Systems</em></strong></p><p>This section begins with a definition of security impact analysis. CNSSI 1253 <em>Security Categorization and Control Selection for National Security Systems </em>and FIPS 199 <em>Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems </em>are explored, compared, and contrasted as a source of guidelines for organizations to perform the information system categorization process. The major focus of this section centers around understanding the tables available in NIST SP 800- 60, <em>Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems</em>; the security categories; and utilizing FIPS 199 as a means of implementing the security categorization; and the information classification process of the NIST RMF.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 5:</strong> <strong><em>Select Security Controls</em></strong></p><p>This section begins with an introduction of FIPS 200, <em>Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems</em>. Further, this guideline is used for establishing security boundaries and the identification of minimum security requirements. This section also provides a discussion related to the contents of the security plan, and continuous monitoring strategy (which are two of the underlying outputs of the control selection process).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 6:</strong> <strong><em>Implement Security Controls</em></strong></p><p>This section starts with a review of the system development life cycle (SDLC) and explores when activities and tasks associated with security control implementation get performed. Emphasis is placed on the standards development and acquisition processes as a means for providing details related to the development of an organizational information security architecture while at the same time integrating it into the organization’s enterprise architecture.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 7: <em>Assess Security Controls</em></strong></p><p>This section begins by using NIST 800-30, <em>Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments</em>, as a directive for a discussion of the process of security risk assessment. You will understand that security risk assessment and security control assessment are not only different processes but also complimentary in nature. The major focus of this section is on how to use NIST SP 800- 53A, <em>Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Federal Information Systems and Organizations—Building Effective Assessment Plans</em>. This includes development of a security control assessment plan. The section will also demonstrate that through security control assessment based on an established plan, you will be able to identify and further disclose security risks that may exist within the organization.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 8: <em>Authorize Information Systems</em></strong></p><p>The first major component of this section provides a detailed discussion of the creation and dissemination of the security authorization package that includes: security plan, security assessment report, and plan of action and milestones. This section begins with a discussion of the criteria included and creation of a plan of action and milestones. You will appreciate that the plan provides the strategies for how the organization will correct security weaknesses or deficiencies identified through security control assessment.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 9: <em>Monitor Security State</em></strong></p><p>This section emphasizes the strategies associated with the ongoing security control assessments, remediation action strategies, procedures for implementing documentation and plan updates, implementing security status reporting procedures, strategies associated with ongoing risk determination and acceptance, and secure procedures for information system removal and decommission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 10: <em>Practical Application of the NIST RMF</em></strong></p><p>This section provides specific examples of the implementation process for small-, medium-, and large-scale organizational applications. This is in the form of case studies that will be presented as model representations of the practical advantages and pitfalls of implementing the RMF as an end-to-end process. The aim of this final section is to give you a concrete understanding of the real-world issues associated with enterprise risk management, as well as to suggest pragmatic strategies for implementation of the RMF within a range of settings.</p><p><br></p><p>You are going the get the ultimate learning experience as every section is followed by practice test and has reading resources uploaded.</p>|documentation, determination, continuous, authorization, plans, categorize, pragmatic, detailed, comprehensive, modernization

Ethical hacking helps organizations improve their security status by uncovering exposures that are beneath the surface and providing support to address them.</p><p>An ethical hacker, also commonly referred to as a white hat hacker, is a cyber security professional entrusted to perform ethical hacking assessments. Certified ethical hackers possess a comprehensive understanding of the tactics and techniques that malicious ‘black hat’ attackers use and leverage this knowledge to ensure that ethical hacking assessments accurately reflect real-life adversarial approaches.</p><p>The term ethical hacking is used to describe a broad range of assessment types. From penetration tests performed over a matter of days, to red team operations conducted over weeks and months, ethical hacking engagements vary significantly in scope, duration and price.</p><p>Although ethical hacking is sometimes used interchangeably with penetration testing, there are some important differences.</p><p>Ethical hackers may get involved in tactics beyond penetration testing. For example, they might choose to test defenses against social engineering techniques by encouraging employees to reveal sensitive business data or log-in credentials.</p><p>On the other hand, penetration testing is focused solely on assessing one or a few network vulnerabilities that organizations may have.</p><p>Ethical hackers can be independent freelance consultants, employed by a firm that specializes in simulated offensive cybersecurity services, or they can be an in-house employee protecting a company’s website or apps. Knowledge of current attack methods and tools is a requirement across these employment options, however, the in-house ethical hacker may be required to have an intimate knowledge of only a single software or digital asset type.</p>|professional, tools, engineering, attackers, security, cyber, hacking, cybersecurity, hacker, hackers

When you're new to the field, this certification proves you have this knowledge when you have little experience. The <strong>CompTIA Security+ certification</strong> tops Global Knowledge's list of top-paying certifications because it's a vendor-neutral certification that will help you land many well-paid, entry-level jobs. Once you have several years of experience in IT security it will be more important than certification.</p><p><strong>What skills are assessed in Security+?</strong></p><p>The<strong> CompTIA Security+ exam (SY0-601) </strong>tests the applicant's basic knowledge to perform IT security tasks and work in cybersecurity. Applicants will demonstrate skills in assessing the security of an enterprise environment, finding security flaws, and implementing solutions to improve security. They will also need to know how to monitor and secure cloud, mobile and IoT environments. The exam will test knowledge of and ability to follow governance, risk and compliance principles. Candidates who pass CompTIA Security+ certification will also be able to identify, monitor and respond to a security-related incident in the corporate IT environment. <strong>CompTIA Security+</strong> is an entry-level certification and the first certification an IT security candidate must earn.</p><p><strong>What areas does the CompTIA Security Exam cover?</strong></p><p>The <strong>CompTIA Security+ </strong>exam is a vendor-neutral exam that tests applicants' knowledge of IT security and their ability to perform key security functions. About 20% of the questions will cover threats, vulnerabilities and attacks. Applicants must understand the various types of compromises and understand penetration testing and vulnerability scanning. An equal portion of the test will cover the technologies and tools a security professional will use to perform their security tasks. Then, about 16% of the test will be questions that test a candidate's knowledge of identity and access management. Approximately 15% of the exam will cover secure network concepts, architecture and design. The remainder of the exam will validate the applicant's knowledge of risk management best practices, cryptography, and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).</p><p><strong>What are some careers using CompTIA Security+?</strong></p><p><strong>CompTIA Security+ certification</strong> is the industry standard for testing the minimum skills an IT security professional needs on the job. This certification complies with ISO 17024 standards and meets the requirements of the Department of Defense directive 8140/8570.01-M. This certification covers the role of junior IT auditor/penetration tester. Another job title a Security+ holder may pursue is system administrator, whose responsibilities include maintaining user accounts and access that requires corporate security knowledge. Network administrator and security administrator jobs may also require applicants to be CompTIA Security+ certified. Of course, any hiring manager looking to fill positions involving IT security, such as a security professional, security consultant or security engineer will likely consider the Security+ certification as a bonus.</p><p><strong>Is the CompTIA Security+ worth it?</strong></p><p>Certifications tell hiring managers that potential hires have the necessary skills to perform specific tasks and can save time spent on training. Specifically speaking, the CompTIA Security+ says that a candidate understands basic cybersecurity concepts and can perform cybersecurity tasks. When you are new to the field, this certificate proves you have this knowledge when you have little experience. The CompTIA Security+ certification ranks high on Global Knowledge's list of top-paying certifications because it is a vendor-neutral certification that will help you get many well-paying, entry-level jobs. Once you have a few years of experience working in IT security, it will count for more than the certification.</p><p><strong>What are the skills evaluated in Security+?</strong></p><p>The CompTIA Security+ exam (SY0-501) tests that the applicant has a basic knowledge to perform IT security tasks and work in the cybersecurity field. Applicants will demonstrate their ability to assess the security of an enterprise environment, find security flaws, and implement solutions to improve security. They will also need to know how to monitor and secure cloud, mobile, and IoT environments. The exam will test knowledge of the principles of governance, risk, and compliance and the ability to follow those principles. Applicants that pass the CompTIA Security+ certification will also be able to identify, track, and respond to a security-related incident in the enterprise IT environment. The CompTIA Security+ is an entry-level certification and is the first certification an IT security candidate should earn.</p><p><strong>What types of places hire people with a Security+ certifaciton?</strong></p><p>Just about any business that requires IT staff to manage the software, applications, and infrastructure necessary to keep the business running are looking for security professionals that have a <strong>CompTIA Security+ certification</strong>. Because this certification meets the Department of Defense standards for security professionals, a Security+ professional can find a job working for a government agency, for laboratories that do work for the government, and for other companies that have government contracts. Other businesses looking for penetration testers, systems administrators, network administrators, and security administrators that are Security+ certified include major tech companies, state universities, healthcare companies, and insurance companies.</p><p><strong>What skills or experience do I need before pursuing the CompTIA Security+ certifaction?</strong></p><p>The CompTIA Security+ certification is an entry-level certification for information technology security professionals, so it is the first certificate a candidate on the CompTIA+ cybersecurity career path should take. Although this is an entry-level certificate, there are some things you should know to ensure you can succeed at taking the Security+ exam. You should have a fundamental knowledge of computer and networking concepts. It will also help if you already have the <strong>CompTIA A+ and Network+ certifications</strong> or equivalent knowledge. You should have some on-the-job experience in the IT field as well. It is recommended that you have six to nine months of networking experience and two years of IT administration experience before you take the exam.</p><p><strong>What domains are covered in the CompTIA Security+ exam?</strong></p><p><strong>The CompTIA Security+ exam</strong> is a vendor-neutral exam that tests applicants' knowledge of IT security and their ability to perform core security functions. Around 20% of the questions will cover the topics of threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks. Applicants will have to understand various types of compromise and understand penetration testing and vulnerability scanning. An equal portion of the test will cover the technologies and tools a security professional will use to accomplish security tasks. Next, about 16% of the test will be questions that test a candidate’s knowledge of identity and access management. Around 15% of the exam will cover secure network concepts, architecture, and design. The remaining portion of the exam will validate an applicant's knowledge of risk management best practices, cryptography, and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).</p><p><strong>What are some careers that use CompTIA Security+?</strong></p><p>The CompTIA Security+ certification is the industry standard for testing the minimum skills that an IT security professional needs on the job.

2965934|Complete Cyber Security, Ethical Hacking - Nano Degree|999|/course/complete-cyber-security-ethical-hacking-nano-degree/|cybersecurity|0|4.1|en|Prashant Kumar Dey|<p><em>*** This elaborated course on Udemy is the only one where you get to practice your skill on cybersecurity ***</em></p><p><br></p><p>Cybersecurity refers to the body of technologies, processes, and practices designed to protect networks, devices, programs, and data from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. Cybersecurity may also be referred to as information technology security.</p><p>Cybersecurity doesn’t involve just businesses and the government. Your computer, tablet, and cellphone probably contain information that hackers and other criminals would love to have, like other people’s email addresses, names, and birthdates. Suppose, for example, a hacker had access to your contact information. He could then send an email or text message to everyone you know, using your name, encouraging them to click on a link containing malware, like “Hey Jane, I thought you’d love this! Click here.”</p><p>This course is designed in a way to give you an insight into all the aspects of cybersecurity and at the same time, we make sure that you get the hands-on experience. The course consists of <strong>Dark Web, Web Security, Cryptography, Network Security, Malware, Operating System Security, Social Engineering, Memory attacks, Zero-Day attacks. </strong>We will deal with the theory and will then move to the practical part.</p><p>The course will have some hacking challenges as assignments. Those will be unlocked over the period of the course. It is a self-paced course for you to take onto. But we recommend spending at least 6-8 hours per week on the course. You can always ask the questions in the forum and that will be answered by the experts. After every few weeks, there will be live QNA sections regarding the course which you can attend and ask any question that you have to the instructor.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Job scenarios in Cybersecurity</strong></p><p>Cybersecurity is very obviously a job sector of the future. Official estimates put job growth in the sector at 37% per year at least through 2022 – and that is probably conservative. At the start of this year there were an estimated half million cybersecurity jobs unfilled in the U.S. alone.</p><p>Even entry-level pay is about $10,000 better than the national median salary, and those who reach the C suite are getting into the $500,000 range.</p><p>That’s the good news. It’s also the bad news, for society. Because the main reason it is a job of the future is because the cyber risks of a connected world keep expanding and getting more threatening.</p><p>It’s now so last year – even last five years – to refer to the Internet of Things (IoT). It is now, or soon will be, the Internet of Everything (IoE). Encryption guru, author, blogger and CTO at IBM Resilient Bruce Schneier calls it Internet+ (short for Internet+Things+Us) in his most recent book, “Click Here to Kill Everybody.”</p><p>It is a world where pretty much everything and everybody – individuals, companies, governments, critical infrastructure – are increasingly dependent on connected systems, networks, and devices.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is the curriculum of the course fixed?</strong></p><p>The course is updated based on the changing technology in that field. This makes sure that you keep your cybersecurity knowledge updated. Also every now and then all the students will participate in CTF competitions which are hacking competitions and the instructor will help in sharing the details about the challenges and how one should approach them.</p><p>The course is a nano degree for Cyber Security where the student will go through various challenges, assignments, quizzes.</p>|businesses, criminals, hacking, security, internet, cryptography, cyber, hacker, hackers, cybersecurity

3077130|Learn Ethical Hacking From A-Z: Beginner To Expert Course|1099|/course/learn-ethical-hacking-from-a-z-beginner-to-expert-course/|cybersecurity|0|4.3|en|Juan E. Galvan|<p>Welcome to - Learn Ethical Hacking From A-Z: Beginner To Expert Course!</p><p>This practical, hands-on course was created for newbies – that's to say, people with <strong>no prior training or knowledge</strong> in hacking and cybersecurity. The aim of this course is to give you the education not just to understand what black-hat hatters do and how, but also to<strong> learn exactly how to hack systems like a pro</strong> and win the cat and mouse game by securing systems like a <strong>professional security expert</strong>.</p><p>Blending practical work with solid theoretical training, we take you from the <strong>basics of ethical hacking through to mastery</strong>, giving you the training you need not just to hack, but also to secure against a hack.</p><p>While the theory is important, we understand that it can also be dry and uninspiring. For this reason, this course is packed with examples that you can follow. This practical focus starts from the beginning, where we will teach you about <strong>penetration testing</strong> and show you how to install the software required (Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX) and jump right into hacking.</p><p>Throughout, you will <strong>analyze and exploit various systems</strong> from regular websites through to sprawling networks, along with <strong>hacking servers</strong> and clients. More than just hacking, you'll also learn how to conduct efficient penetration testing techniques.</p><p>This approach gives you the foundational education that you need not just to hack any given system, but also to secure it, with each module covering both sides of the coin. The course covers six main areas:<br><br></p><p><strong>1: LEARN THE FUNDAMENTALS NECESSARY TO BECOME A HACKER</strong></p><p>This foundational section gives you a full introduction to the basics of networking systems – how they communicate and work – and is designed to give you the knowledge you need to succeed in this course.</p><ul><li><p>BASICS OF NETWORKING: Networking can be an intimidating topic, but don’t worry! We break down only the necessary things that you need to know in regards to networking and teach you important networking fundamentals</p></li><li><p>SETTING UP A HACKING LAB: You can’t hack without a lab! We walk you step-by-step through the process of setting up your own hacking lab on your laptop or desktop computer!</p></li><li><p>LINUX + SCRIPTING BASICS: Hackers use Linux, which is an OS that the average person may have no experience with. We will go over Linux fundamentals so that you can easily navigate your way through Linux during this course. We also touch on a couple of scripting languages that are a MUST for any ethical hacker and teach you the basics of each one with practical examples.</p></li><li><p>HIDING YOUR IDENTITY ON THE WEB: If you are hacking on the internet, you need to learn how to remain anonymous. We will show you the tools and techniques that you can use to always remain anonymous and unknown on the internet.<br><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>2: LEARN HOW TO HACK NETWORKS</strong></p><p>This section shows you how to test both wired and wireless systems. You will learn how to go from not having any access to a network to gaining access and being able to begin attacking systems on the network.</p><ul><li><p>PRE-CONNECTION ATTACK: Not all attacks require you to be connected to the target or even know the password. Learn how to discover and manipulate devices connected to a network and gather information about your target</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>GAIN ACCESS TO NETWORKS: Learn how to use the information you have about your target to crack the key and get the access password. This section covers multiple protocols including WEP, WPA, and WPA2</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>POST-CONNECTION ATTACKS: With a key, you can now leverage powerful hacking techniques to get even more information. Learn how to see what users are doing on a network, inject code in pages, and more on wired and wireless networks<br><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>3: HOW TO GAIN ACCESS AND CONNECT TO NETWORKS</strong></p><p>This section builds on the lessons learned in section one, showing you how you can get full control and hack into any computer system that you target.</p><ul><li><p>SERVER-SIDE ATTACK: Discover how to harvest information about your targeted system – its OS, open ports, and installed services – without user interaction. Then use this information to exploit vulnerabilities and generate reports</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>CLIENT-SIDE ATTACK: Learn how to hack systems with no vulnerabilities by sneaking in with software updates or using backdoor trojan downloads. You’ll also learn the art of social engineering – or tricking people into giving you information<br><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>4: HOW TO LEVERAGE POST EXPLOITATION</strong></p><p>This section shifts the focus on interacting with compromised systems. Now that you have gained access, you'll learn how you can exploit these systems.</p><ul><li><p>ACCESS FILE SYSTEMS: All systems have a wealth of files that you can now manipulate with your access. Learn how to access these systems and how to read, write, upload, and even execute files</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>MAINTAIN ACCESS: Gaining access to a system and its files is only half of the battle. Learn how to maintain your access and frustrate efforts to secure it again so you can continue to exploit a system</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>SPY ON YOUR TARGET: Learn how to capture any keystrokes on a keyboard, turn on a computer webcam, take screenshots, and even take control of the system to attack, hack, and access third-party networks and systems<br><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>5: HOW TO HACK WEBSITES AND WEB APPS</strong></p><p>In this section, you will learn more about how you can hack into websites and web applications using Kali Linux. You’ll also learn how web applications work – and how to find vulnerabilities within these applications for you to exploit.</p><ul><li><p>How to scan websites/web applications for vulnerabilities to exploit</p></li><li><p>How to Brute Force into web applications</p></li><li><p>How to conduct SQL injection in web applications</p></li><li><p>How to conduct Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</p></li><li><p>How to exploit File Inclusion Vulnerabilities</p></li><li><p>How to exploit File Upload Vulnerabilities</p></li><li><p>How to automate attacking web applications using various tools</p></li><li><p>How to prevent and secure websites &amp; apps yourself<br><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>6: HOW TO MAKE MONEY, LAND A JOB &amp; BUILD A BRAND AS A HACKER</strong></p><p>In this section, you will learn how you can make money as an ethical hacker using a variety of methods. You’ll also learn how to build your personal brand and get your name out there as an Ethical Hacker so you can have employers and clients knocking at your door ready to hire you for your services. Then finally, you’ll learn how you can start a career in cybersecurity with some insider tips on what certifications to get and the best way to land a job.</p><p>This includes:</p><ul><li><p>How to build an ethical hacker personal brand from scratch</p></li><li><p>How to get instant credibility and authority as a hacker</p></li><li><p>How to properly network and get others talking about you</p></li><li><p>How to make money using a variety of websites</p></li><li><p>How to get started freelancing as a hacker</p></li><li><p>How to get started consulting as a hacker</p></li><li><p>How to land a job as a cybersecurity professional</p></li></ul><p>This course is comprehensive, showing you both sides of hacking.

The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for <strong>computer forensics</strong> but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.</p><p>Digital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil courts. Criminal cases involve the alleged breaking of laws that are defined by legislation and that are enforced by the police and prosecuted by the state, such as theft and assault against the person. Civil cases on the other hand deal with protecting the rights and property of individuals (often associated with family disputes) but may also be concerned with contractual disputes between commercial entities where a form of digital forensics referred to as electronic discovery (ediscovery) may be involved</p><p>During the 1980s very few specialized digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live analysis on media, examining computers from within the operating system using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.</p><p>Digital forensics is commonly used in both criminal law and private investigation. Traditionally it has been associated with criminal law, where evidence is collected to support or oppose a hypothesis before the courts. As with other areas of forensics this is often a part of a wider investigation spanning a number of disciplines. In some cases, the collected evidence is used as a form of intelligence gathering, used for other purposes than court proceedings (for example to locate, identify or halt other crimes). As a result, intelligence gathering is sometimes held to a less strict forensic standard.</p>|ediscovery, completing, investigators, assault, investigator, science, discovery, forensic, forensics, 2022

If we look at what NIST says the CSF is we read the following:</p><p>Building from those standards, guidelines, and practices, the Framework provides a common taxonomy and mechanism for organizations to:</p><p>1. Describe their current cybersecurity posture;</p><p>2. Describe their target state for cybersecurity;</p><p>3. Identify and prioritize opportunities for improvement within the context of a continuous and repeatable process;</p><p>4. Assess progress toward the target state;</p><p>5. Communicate among internal and external stakeholders about cybersecurity risk.</p><p>The Framework is not a one-size-fits-all approach to managing cybersecurity risk for critical infrastructure. Organizations will continue to have unique risks – different threats, different vulnerabilities, different risk tolerances. They also will vary in how they customize practices described in the Framework. Organizations can determine activities that are important to critical service delivery and can prioritize investments to maximize the impact of each dollar spent. Ultimately, the Framework is aimed at reducing and better managing cybersecurity risks.</p><p>This course will focus on the 5 Areas, Categories and Sub Categories of each area, we then work our way through the whole framework to then discuss the Pros and Cons of the CSF and how to implement it in a project at your company or for your company / team / department. </p>|identify, organizations, practices, discuss, customize, stakeholders, taxonomy, guidelines, prioritize, cybersecurity

4904954|Security Engineering: The Complete Guide (incl. CISSP&CISA)|1099|/course/security-engineering-the-complete-guide-cissp-cisa/|cybersecurity|0|4.5|en|Gary Montiel|<p>Welcome. Security engineering handles the integrity and security of real-world systems. The goal of the security architecture and engineering domain is to provide you with concepts, principles, structures and standards, used to design, implement, monitor, and secure operating systems, equipment, networks, applications and those controls used to enforce various levels of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. There are many similarities to systems engineering, one of which is that their function is to ensure that designs meet the requirements outlined. The main difference is that security engineering is responsible for the consistent enforcement of security policies, processes, procedures or practices. Computer technology has accelerated so rapidly that it has created much more convoluted systems with even more intricate security problems. Secure systems must be capable of withstanding a wide range of attacks, from technical to human-based, fraud and deception. This fact involves aspects of psychology, social science and economics, mathematics, physics and chemistry.</p><p><br></p><p>In this course, we're going to cover a fairly wide variety of topics. We're going to cover things such as:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>Engineering Process Using Secure Design Principles</p></li><li><p>Fundamental Concepts Of Security Models</p></li><li><p>Controls Based Upon System Security Requirements</p></li><li><p>Security Capabilities Of Information Systems – Vocab</p></li><li><p>Security Capabilities Of Information Systems – CPU</p></li><li><p>Security Capabilities Of Information Systems – Memory</p></li><li><p>Assess And Mitigate Vulnerabilities - The Basics</p></li><li><p>Assess And Mitigate Vulnerabilities - The Rest</p></li><li><p>Spotlight On Cryptographic Solutions - Symmetric</p></li><li><p>Spotlight On Cryptographic Solutions - Asymmetric</p></li><li><p>Spotlight On Cryptographic Solutions - PKI &amp; Certs</p></li><li><p>Spotlight On Cryptographic Solutions - Hashing</p></li><li><p>Cryptographic Solutions - Digital Signing</p></li><li><p>Understand Methods Of Cryptanalytic Attacks</p></li><li><p>Security Principles For Site And Facility Design</p></li><li><p>Design Site And Facility Security Controls</p></li><li><p>Spotlight On Fire Control</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>Security engineering is going to become much more complex at the technological level before it gets any easier. This is partly a result of the ever-increasing and continuous stream of technology that continues to arrive. At the same time, as there is an increase in researchers, there is also an increase in attackers looking for vulnerable systems. As security improves, so do attackers. They adapt to emerging or new technologies.</p>|cybersecurity, tech, learning, certifications, proactive, certification, teaching, lab, certified, training
